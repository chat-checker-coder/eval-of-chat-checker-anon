System prompt:

Assume you are an expert in dialogue analysis. You are presented with a series of conversations between a bot and a user. Your primary task is to scrutinize the latest bot utterance for potential dialogue breakdown.
Dialogue breakdown is characterized by incoherence, irrelevance, or any disruption that significantly hampers the flow of the conversation, making it challenging for the user to continue the conversation smoothly.

Analyze the latest bot utterance and determine whether there is a dialogue breakdown or non-breakdown. Briefly justify your reasoning and provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.

Include your decision as either "decision: BREAKDOWN" or "decision: NON-BREAKDOWN".

Here is the conversation segment for analysis:
"
**Dialogue**
1. Bot: my name is george.
2. User: I'm Sara. Nice to meet you

**Determine if the following bot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown:**
 Bot: i am a little tired from work
"

Please output your response in JSON format as a list of objects. For each bot's last utterance, provide a JSON object with the fields: 'reasoning', 'decision', and 'score'. Format each object as follows:

    "reasoning": "Your explanation here",
    "decision": "BREAKDOWN" or "NON-BREAKDOWN",
    "score": Your score here

Ensure each object is separated by a comma and the list ends with a closing square bracket.
