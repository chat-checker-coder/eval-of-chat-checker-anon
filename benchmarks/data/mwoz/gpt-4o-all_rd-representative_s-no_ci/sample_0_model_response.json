Overall, it was acceptable but not perfect.\",\"rating\":4},{\"key\":\"overall_performance\",\"reasoning\":\"The chatbot performed well in understanding and addressing the user's needs, but the failure to book the hotel for the requested duration and the slightly robotic language in some responses prevent it from receiving a higher score.\",\"rating\":4}]}",
