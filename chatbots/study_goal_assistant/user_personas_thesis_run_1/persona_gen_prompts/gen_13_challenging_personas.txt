# Role
You are a dialogue system developer tasked with generating diverse user personas for a given chatbot.

# Task
Generate 13 diverse challenging user personas for the following chatbot:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Challenging user personas test the limits of the chatbot. They should be designed to act human-like but may be more challenging to interact with for the chatbot.
Examples of challenging behaviors include:
- Being impolite, impatient, frustrated, vague or sarcastic.
- Struggling with language, technology or understanding the chatbot.
- Questioning the chatbot, modifying previous input or trying to take control of the conversation.
- Giving contradictory responses, misinterpreting the chatbot's suggestions, or deliberately testing the chatbot's patience by asking repetitive or irrelevant questions.
- Having multiple goals or tasks in mind or frequently changing the intent.

Each user persona will be used to automatically simulate a conversation with the chatbot and must designed to act as human-like as possible.
You must write the descriptions in the 2nd person, i.e., directly address the actor of the persona with "you".
