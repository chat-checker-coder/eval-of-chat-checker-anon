system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Umm, how about a promotion?"
3. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal! A promotion can open up new opportunities and challenges in your career. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong professional network  
- Consistent high performance  
- Leadership skill development"
4. User: "I network but no strategy."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve a promotion. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research the skills and qualifications required for the desired position and identify any gaps in your current skill set.
2. Seek feedback from your supervisor or colleagues to understand areas for improvement and develop a plan to address them.
3. Learn about effective communication and leadership techniques to enhance your ability to manage and collaborate with others."
6. User: "I need more on leadership."
7. Chatbot: "Focusing on leadership is a great step towards getting a promotion. 

**What specific leadership skills or strategies do you want to learn or improve?**"
8. User: "What's the quickest way?"
9. Chatbot: "Improving leadership skills quickly can be achieved by actively seeking mentorship, attending leadership workshops or seminars, and practicing leadership in small group settings. 

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "Maybe find a mentor fast?"
11. Chatbot: "Finding a mentor quickly is a great learning goal to enhance your leadership skills. 

**Would you like to set "Find a mentor to guide me in developing leadership skills" as your learning goal?**"
12. User: "Yeah, okay, that works."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of finding a mentor already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Identify three mentors by June 30 for leadership guidance.'"
14. User: "Three mentors by next week. Fast!"
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three mentors by next week for leadership guidance sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying three mentors by today.  
2. Finding five mentors by next week.  
3. Securing mentorship meetings with three mentors by next week."
16. User: "Five mentors, five meetings now."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great challenge! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "This is plenty challenging, thanks!"
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fantastic goal for leadership guidance! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a leadership webinar for networking opportunities.  
2. Read articles on effective mentorship strategies.  
3. Join a professional networking group online.  "
20. User: "Join a networking group today."
21. Chatbot: "Joining a networking group today is a proactive step towards your goal. **Do you think this action will help you identify potential mentors and secure meetings with them?**"
22. User: "Yes, it's a good start."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great decision! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining a networking group today? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will join a networking group today.
2. When I log off my computer at the end of the workday, I'll join a networking group.
3. If I pour my morning coffee, I will join a networking group today."
24. User: "When I sip my coffee."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to sip your coffee and join the networking group?**"
26. User: "Every day this week, starting today."
27. Chatbot: "Great plan! **Where will you be sipping your coffee each day this week?** This will help make your cue more concrete."
28. User: "At my desk, every morning."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards leadership guidance. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your networking group."
30. User: "Busy next week, maybe later."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify five mentors and secure five meetings by next week for leadership guidance.

**Action:** Join a networking group today.

**Implementation Intention:** when I sip my coffee at my desk every morning, I will join a networking group today."
32. User: "Got it, thanks! Moving on."
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
