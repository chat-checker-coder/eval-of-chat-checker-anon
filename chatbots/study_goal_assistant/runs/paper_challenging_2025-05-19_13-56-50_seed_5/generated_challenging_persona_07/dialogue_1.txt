1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm thinking about traveling more and also maybe learning a bit of photography, but I keep getting sidetracked by wanting to learn to cook better too. It's all over the place, I know!"
3. CHATBOT: "It sounds like you have a lot of exciting interests! **Would you say your primary goal is to explore new places, capture beautiful moments, or enhance your culinary skills?**"
4. USER: "Capturing moments while cooking abroad?"
5. CHATBOT: "Capturing moments while cooking abroad sounds like an incredible adventure! You'll be able to combine your love for travel, photography, and culinary arts in a unique way. 

**Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- High-quality camera equipment  
- Experience in food photography  
- Knowledge of local cuisines"
6. USER: "Uh, not really. Just ideas."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve capturing moments while cooking abroad. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Learn about different photography techniques to effectively capture the essence of cooking in various cultural settings.

2. Research and practice using different camera settings and lighting to enhance food photography while traveling.

3. Study storytelling methods to convey the experience and emotions of cooking abroad through visual media."
8. USER: "Understand cooking photography basics?"
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of understanding cooking photography basics already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three cooking photography techniques by June 2nd."
10. USER: "Explore cooking photography techniques monthly."
11. CHATBOT: "I see you want to explore techniques monthly. **When exactly do you want to start this exploration?**"
12. USER: "Maybe after my knitting class?"
13. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good plan. **When does your knitting class end, so you can start exploring cooking photography techniques?**"
14. USER: "The class ends in May."
15. CHATBOT: "Great! So you could start exploring cooking photography techniques in June. **How will you measure your progress each month?**"
16. USER: "By sharing photos with friends."
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a fun way to track your progress! **Would you like to set a specific number of photos to share each month?**"
18. USER: "Not really sure how many."
19. CHATBOT: "That's okay! You can start with a small number and adjust as you go. **How about starting with sharing 3 photos each month?**"
20. USER: "Hmm, that's doable, I guess."
21. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'exploring cooking photography techniques' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Sharing 3 photos with friends today.
2. Sharing 6 photos each month starting in June.
3. Sharing 3 photos weekly starting in June."
22. USER: "Let's try 3 weekly photos."
23. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, like maybe adding a specific theme or style to each week's photos?**"
24. USER: "Perhaps adding knitting themes?"
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a creative twist! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by incorporating a new knitting theme each week, or is this the most challenging version of your goal?**"
26. USER: "Adding a new knitting theme weekly!"
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a fantastic and creative goal! Now that I know you want to explore cooking photography techniques, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube videos on cooking photography techniques.  
2. Read a book on food styling and photography.  
3. Join an online cooking photography workshop.  "
28. USER: "Watch some Youtube videos first."
29. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great starting point! **Do you think watching a specific number of videos or focusing on certain topics within cooking photography would be most beneficial for you?**"
30. USER: "I'm not sure where to start."
31. CHATBOT: "That's completely understandable! **How about starting with 3 videos that cover basic cooking photography techniques, such as lighting, composition, and styling?** This could give you a solid foundation to build upon."
32. USER: "Sounds like a good plan."
33. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching those 3 YouTube videos on cooking photography techniques? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I'll watch 3 YouTube videos on cooking photography.
2. When I brew my morning coffee, I'll watch 3 YouTube videos on cooking photography.
3. If I sit down at my desk after dinner, I'll watch 3 YouTube videos on cooking photography."
34. USER: "When I brew my morning coffee."
35. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable and noticeable cue! **Is there a specific day or days in the next 7 days when you plan to brew your morning coffee and watch the videos?**"
36. USER: "Maybe Wednesday and Saturday mornings."
37. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Where will you be brewing your morning coffee on Wednesday and Saturday mornings?** This will help solidify your cue."
38. USER: "In my cozy kitchen corner."
39. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards cooking photography. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your Youtube videos."
40. USER: "I prefer going at my pace."
41. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Explore cooking photography techniques by sharing 3 photos with friends each week, starting in June, with a new knitting theme each week.

**Action:** Watch 3 Youtube videos on basic cooking photography techniques, focusing on lighting, composition, and styling.

**Implementation Intention:** when I brew my morning coffee in my cozy kitchen corner on Wednesday and Saturday mornings then Watch 3 Youtube videos on basic cooking photography techniques, focusing on lighting, composition, and styling."
