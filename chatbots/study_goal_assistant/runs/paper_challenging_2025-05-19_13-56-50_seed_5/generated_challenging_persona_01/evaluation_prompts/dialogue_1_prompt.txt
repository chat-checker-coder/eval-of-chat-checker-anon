system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Um, well... I guess... learn French? Or, no, maybe I should focus on improving my design skills? What do you think?"
3. Chatbot: "Both learning French and improving your design skills are excellent goals! They can open up new opportunities and enhance your personal and professional life. **Which one resonates more with you right now, or is there another goal you'd like to focus on?**"
4. User: "Improving design skills, for sure."
5. Chatbot: "Improving your design skills is a fantastic choice! It can really elevate your creative abilities and open up new opportunities in your career. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind to enhance your design skills?**

For example:  
- Enroll in design courses  
- Join design communities  
- Practice daily with design tools"
6. User: "Uh... actually, I keep changing strategies."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improving your design skills. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Explore and study different design principles and theories to understand the foundational concepts of design.
2. Practice using design software tools, such as Adobe Creative Suite or Sketch, to enhance technical proficiency.
3. Analyze and critique existing designs to identify effective techniques and areas for improvement."
8. User: "Maybe start with design principles?"
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring and studying design principles already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Study five design principles by June 2, 2025."
10. User: "How about becoming a design expert?"
11. Chatbot: "Becoming a design expert is a great aspiration! **What specific steps or milestones would you like to achieve on your path to becoming a design expert, and by when?**"
12. User: "I don't know, just... quickly?"
13. Chatbot: "I understand the desire to achieve your goal quickly. **Could you identify a specific design principle or theory you want to master first, and set a date by when you want to achieve this mastery?**"
14. User: "Color theory by next month?"
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **Could you specify a measurable outcome, like completing a course or creating a project using color theory, by the end of next month?**"
16. User: "Create a color-focused design."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating a color-focused design using color theory sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Completing the design today.  
2. Finalizing the design by next week.  
3. Or increasing the difficulty by using five color theories."
18. User: "Adding five color theories."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "Is there a harder idea?"
21. Chatbot: "You could aim to create multiple designs, each using a different set of five color theories, or perhaps incorporate interactive elements that change colors based on user input. **Do you think this would be feasible for you, or is the current goal challenging enough?**"
22. User: "Maybe something else entirely?"
23. Chatbot: "You could aim to present your color-focused design in a public exhibition or online platform for feedback by the end of next month. **Does this sound like a challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
24. User: "Online exhibition sounds exhausting."
25. Chatbot: "I understand, an online exhibition can be quite demanding. **Would you like to stick with the idea of using five color theories, or is there another aspect you'd like to explore to make your goal more challenging?**"
26. User: "Actually, learn advanced typography instead."
27. Chatbot: "Learning advanced typography alongside creating a color-focused design sounds like a challenging and enriching goal. **Is this the final version of your goal, or would you like to add anything else to make it even more challenging?**"
28. User: "Focus on typography only?"
29. Chatbot: "Focusing solely on mastering advanced typography by the end of next month is a focused and challenging goal. **Is this the final version of your goal, or would you like to add any additional elements to it?**"
30. User: "Consider adding logo creation."
31. Chatbot: "Incorporating logo creation into your goal of mastering advanced typography by the end of next month makes it even more challenging and comprehensive. **Is this the final version of your goal, or would you like to adjust it further?**"
32. User: "Add branding elements too?"
33. Chatbot: "Including branding elements along with logo creation and advanced typography makes your goal quite ambitious and challenging. **Is this the final version of your goal, or do you have any more adjustments in mind?**"
34. User: "Seems okay for now."
35. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to focus on mastering advanced typography, logo creation, and branding elements. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Enroll in an online typography design course.  
2. Read a book on advanced logo design techniques.  
3. Attend a branding workshop or seminar.  "
36. User: "Maybe start with a typography course?"
37. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid starting point! **Do you think enrolling in an online typography course is the best action to begin with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
38. User: "Yes, I'll start there."
39. Chatbot: "Great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of enrolling in the online typography course? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will enroll in an online typography course.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll sign up for an online typography course.
3. If I pour my morning coffee, I will register for an online typography course."
40. User: "When I wake up, I'll enroll."
41. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to wake up and enroll in the course?**"
42. User: "Probably tomorrow morning."
43. Chatbot: "Great! **Where will you be when you wake up tomorrow morning to enroll in the course?** This will help make your cue more concrete."
44. User: "At home, in my bedroom."
45. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering typography and branding. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your course enrollment."
46. User: "Uh, maybe not right now."
47. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Focus on mastering advanced typography, logo creation, and branding elements by the end of next month.

**Action:** Enroll in an online typography course

**Implementation Intention:** when I wake up in my bedroom tomorrow morning, I'll enroll in an online typography course"
48. User: "Okay, thanks. I'll figure it out."
49. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
