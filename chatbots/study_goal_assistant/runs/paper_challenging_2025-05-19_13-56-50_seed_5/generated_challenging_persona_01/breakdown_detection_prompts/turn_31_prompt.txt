system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Um, well... I guess... learn French? Or, no, maybe I should focus on improving my design skills? What do you think?"
3. Chatbot: "Both learning French and improving your design skills are excellent goals! They can open up new opportunities and enhance your personal and professional life. **Which one resonates more with you right now, or is there another goal you'd like to focus on?**"
4. User: "Improving design skills, for sure."
5. Chatbot: "Improving your design skills is a fantastic choice! It can really elevate your creative abilities and open up new opportunities in your career. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind to enhance your design skills?**

For example:  
- Enroll in design courses  
- Join design communities  
- Practice daily with design tools"
6. User: "Uh... actually, I keep changing strategies."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improving your design skills. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Explore and study different design principles and theories to understand the foundational concepts of design.
2. Practice using design software tools, such as Adobe Creative Suite or Sketch, to enhance technical proficiency.
3. Analyze and critique existing designs to identify effective techniques and areas for improvement."
8. User: "Maybe start with design principles?"
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring and studying design principles already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Study five design principles by June 2, 2025."
10. User: "How about becoming a design expert?"
11. Chatbot: "Becoming a design expert is a great aspiration! **What specific steps or milestones would you like to achieve on your path to becoming a design expert, and by when?**"
12. User: "I don't know, just... quickly?"
13. Chatbot: "I understand the desire to achieve your goal quickly. **Could you identify a specific design principle or theory you want to master first, and set a date by when you want to achieve this mastery?**"
14. User: "Color theory by next month?"
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **Could you specify a measurable outcome, like completing a course or creating a project using color theory, by the end of next month?**"
16. User: "Create a color-focused design."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating a color-focused design using color theory sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Completing the design today.  
2. Finalizing the design by next week.  
3. Or increasing the difficulty by using five color theories."
18. User: "Adding five color theories."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "Is there a harder idea?"
21. Chatbot: "You could aim to create multiple designs, each using a different set of five color theories, or perhaps incorporate interactive elements that change colors based on user input. **Do you think this would be feasible for you, or is the current goal challenging enough?**"
22. User: "Maybe something else entirely?"
23. Chatbot: "You could aim to present your color-focused design in a public exhibition or online platform for feedback by the end of next month. **Does this sound like a challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
24. User: "Online exhibition sounds exhausting."
25. Chatbot: "I understand, an online exhibition can be quite demanding. **Would you like to stick with the idea of using five color theories, or is there another aspect you'd like to explore to make your goal more challenging?**"
26. User: "Actually, learn advanced typography instead."
27. Chatbot: "Learning advanced typography alongside creating a color-focused design sounds like a challenging and enriching goal. **Is this the final version of your goal, or would you like to add anything else to make it even more challenging?**"
28. User: "Focus on typography only?"
29. Chatbot: "Focusing solely on mastering advanced typography by the end of next month is a focused and challenging goal. **Is this the final version of your goal, or would you like to add any additional elements to it?**"
30. User: "Consider adding logo creation."
