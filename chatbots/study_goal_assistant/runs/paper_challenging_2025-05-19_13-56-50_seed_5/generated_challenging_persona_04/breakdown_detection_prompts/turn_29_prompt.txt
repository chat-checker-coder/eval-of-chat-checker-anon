system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Maybe, uh, doing better in school?"
3. Chatbot: "Improving your performance in school is a fantastic goal! It can open up so many opportunities for you in the future. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to help you achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Effective time management skills  
- Strong study habits  
- Access to tutoring resources"
4. User: "Strategy? Isn't that, like, optional?"
5. Chatbot: "Having a strategy can really help in achieving your goals more effectively, but it's okay if you don't have one yet. **Do you think you might need help in developing a strategy to do better in school?**"
6. User: "Yeah, I guess, maybe. Kinda."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve doing better in school. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and implement effective study techniques that improve retention and understanding of the material.
2. Develop a time management plan to allocate sufficient time for each subject and balance schoolwork with extracurricular activities.
3. Seek feedback from teachers on areas of improvement and create a plan to address those areas."
8. User: "How about... no goals yet?"
9. Chatbot: "That's perfectly okay! Sometimes it takes a bit of reflection to identify the right learning goals. 

**What do you think you need to learn or improve on to do better in school?**"
10. User: "Not sure. Maybe better focus?"
11. Chatbot: "Improving focus is a great learning goal! You could explore strategies like mindfulness exercises, setting specific study times, or creating a distraction-free study environment. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around improving focus?**"
12. User: "Meh, focus isn't that crucial."
13. Chatbot: "That's understandable. Let's explore other areas that might help you do better in school. 

**Is there a specific subject or skill you feel you need to improve on?**"
14. User: "Math, but it's kinda boring."
15. Chatbot: "I understand that math can sometimes feel boring, but finding ways to make it more engaging could be a great learning goal. You could explore interactive math games, real-world applications, or study groups to make it more interesting. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around making math more engaging and improving your skills in it?**"
16. User: "I guess, but what else?"
17. Chatbot: "In addition to making math more engaging, you could set a learning goal to develop problem-solving skills, which are crucial in math. This could involve practicing different types of math problems, learning new problem-solving techniques, or even teaching math concepts to others to reinforce your understanding. 

**Does focusing on problem-solving skills in math sound like a good learning goal for you?**"
18. User: "Yeah, sorta, in theory."
19. Chatbot: "Great! Focusing on problem-solving skills can really enhance your understanding and make math more enjoyable. 

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal, or is there another area you'd like to explore?**"
20. User: "Maybe something less math-y?"
21. Chatbot: "Absolutely, we can explore other areas! How about focusing on improving your reading comprehension or writing skills, which are valuable across all subjects? 

**Does setting a learning goal around enhancing reading or writing skills sound appealing to you?**"
22. User: "Reading, maybe. Writing sounds tedious."
23. Chatbot: "Improving reading comprehension is a fantastic goal and can make learning in all subjects easier and more enjoyable. You could focus on strategies like summarizing texts, identifying key themes, or expanding your vocabulary. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around enhancing your reading skills?**"
24. User: "Sure, why not? Reading's okay."
25. Chatbot: "Your goal of enhancing reading comprehension skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Summarize three texts weekly to enhance comprehension by June 30."
26. User: "Um, maybe two texts monthly?"
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan! **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
28. User: "Sometime this, like, year?"
