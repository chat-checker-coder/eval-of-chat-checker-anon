Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Maybe, uh, doing better in school?"
3. CHATBOT: "Improving your performance in school is a fantastic goal! It can open up so many opportunities for you in the future. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to help you achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Effective time management skills  
- Strong study habits  
- Access to tutoring resources"
4. USER: "Strategy? Isn't that, like, optional?"
5. CHATBOT: "Having a strategy can really help in achieving your goals more effectively, but it's okay if you don't have one yet. **Do you think you might need help in developing a strategy to do better in school?**"
6. USER: "Yeah, I guess, maybe. Kinda."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve doing better in school. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and implement effective study techniques that improve retention and understanding of the material.
2. Develop a time management plan to allocate sufficient time for each subject and balance schoolwork with extracurricular activities.
3. Seek feedback from teachers on areas of improvement and create a plan to address those areas."
8. USER: "How about... no goals yet?"
9. CHATBOT: "That's perfectly okay! Sometimes it takes a bit of reflection to identify the right learning goals. 

**What do you think you need to learn or improve on to do better in school?**"
10. USER: "Not sure. Maybe better focus?"
11. CHATBOT: "Improving focus is a great learning goal! You could explore strategies like mindfulness exercises, setting specific study times, or creating a distraction-free study environment. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around improving focus?**"
12. USER: "Meh, focus isn't that crucial."
13. CHATBOT: "That's understandable. Let's explore other areas that might help you do better in school. 

**Is there a specific subject or skill you feel you need to improve on?**"
14. USER: "Math, but it's kinda boring."
15. CHATBOT: "I understand that math can sometimes feel boring, but finding ways to make it more engaging could be a great learning goal. You could explore interactive math games, real-world applications, or study groups to make it more interesting. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around making math more engaging and improving your skills in it?**"
16. USER: "I guess, but what else?"
17. CHATBOT: "In addition to making math more engaging, you could set a learning goal to develop problem-solving skills, which are crucial in math. This could involve practicing different types of math problems, learning new problem-solving techniques, or even teaching math concepts to others to reinforce your understanding. 

**Does focusing on problem-solving skills in math sound like a good learning goal for you?**"
18. USER: "Yeah, sorta, in theory."
19. CHATBOT: "Great! Focusing on problem-solving skills can really enhance your understanding and make math more enjoyable. 

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal, or is there another area you'd like to explore?**"
20. USER: "Maybe something less math-y?"
21. CHATBOT: "Absolutely, we can explore other areas! How about focusing on improving your reading comprehension or writing skills, which are valuable across all subjects? 

**Does setting a learning goal around enhancing reading or writing skills sound appealing to you?**"
22. USER: "Reading, maybe. Writing sounds tedious."
23. CHATBOT: "Improving reading comprehension is a fantastic goal and can make learning in all subjects easier and more enjoyable. You could focus on strategies like summarizing texts, identifying key themes, or expanding your vocabulary. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around enhancing your reading skills?**"
24. USER: "Sure, why not? Reading's okay."
25. CHATBOT: "Your goal of enhancing reading comprehension skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Summarize three texts weekly to enhance comprehension by June 30."
26. USER: "Um, maybe two texts monthly?"
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good plan! **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
28. USER: "Sometime this, like, year?"
29. CHATBOT: "I understand you're aiming for this year. **Could you specify an exact date, like December 31st, to achieve your goal?**"
30. USER: "December 31st sounds fine."
31. CHATBOT: "Your goal of summarizing two texts monthly sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Summarizing two texts weekly starting today.  
2. Summarizing four texts monthly by December 31st.  
3. Summarizing two texts bi-weekly starting this week."
32. USER: "All seem a bit ambitious."
33. CHATBOT: "I understand, it's important to find a balance. **Would you be comfortable with summarizing three texts monthly instead of two?**"
34. USER: "Eh, two's pushing it."
35. CHATBOT: "That's completely understandable. **Would you like to keep your original goal of summarizing two texts monthly, or is there any other aspect you'd like to adjust?**"
36. USER: "Let's stick with two."
37. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to summarize two texts monthly to enhance your reading comprehension skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read two articles from a reputable journal.  
2. Watch a TED Talk and summarize its key points.  
3. Discuss a book chapter with a study group.  "
38. USER: "Reading two short articles, maybe."
39. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a practical and achievable action to start with. **Do you think reading two short articles each month will effectively help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
40. USER: "Reading's a decent start..."
41. CHATBOT: "Reading two short articles monthly is a great way to start building a reading habit. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one article.
2. When I sit down for lunch on weekends, I'll read an article.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will read an article."
42. USER: "After breakfast, read something?"
43. CHATBOT: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that could serve as a reminder to read an article afterward?**"
44. USER: "Probably my kitchen table."
45. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable and consistent location. **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days of the week to ensure it happens regularly?**"
46. USER: "Yeah, like weekends maybe."
47. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Weekends can be a perfect time to relax and read. **Would you like to finalize this cue as "When I finish breakfast at my kitchen table on weekends, I will read an article"?**"
48. USER: "Yeah, that works, I guess."
49. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enhancing your skills. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
50. USER: "Sure, whatever works."
51. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Summarize two texts monthly to enhance reading comprehension skills by December 31st.

**Action:** Reading two short articles monthly

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish breakfast at my kitchen table on weekends, I will read an article"
