system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Maybe, uh, doing better in school?"
3. Chatbot: "Improving your performance in school is a fantastic goal! It can open up so many opportunities for you in the future. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to help you achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Effective time management skills  
- Strong study habits  
- Access to tutoring resources"
4. User: "Strategy? Isn't that, like, optional?"
5. Chatbot: "Having a strategy can really help in achieving your goals more effectively, but it's okay if you don't have one yet. **Do you think you might need help in developing a strategy to do better in school?**"
6. User: "Yeah, I guess, maybe. Kinda."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve doing better in school. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and implement effective study techniques that improve retention and understanding of the material.
2. Develop a time management plan to allocate sufficient time for each subject and balance schoolwork with extracurricular activities.
3. Seek feedback from teachers on areas of improvement and create a plan to address those areas."
8. User: "How about... no goals yet?"
9. Chatbot: "That's perfectly okay! Sometimes it takes a bit of reflection to identify the right learning goals. 

**What do you think you need to learn or improve on to do better in school?**"
10. User: "Not sure. Maybe better focus?"
11. Chatbot: "Improving focus is a great learning goal! You could explore strategies like mindfulness exercises, setting specific study times, or creating a distraction-free study environment. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around improving focus?**"
12. User: "Meh, focus isn't that crucial."
13. Chatbot: "That's understandable. Let's explore other areas that might help you do better in school. 

**Is there a specific subject or skill you feel you need to improve on?**"
14. User: "Math, but it's kinda boring."
15. Chatbot: "I understand that math can sometimes feel boring, but finding ways to make it more engaging could be a great learning goal. You could explore interactive math games, real-world applications, or study groups to make it more interesting. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around making math more engaging and improving your skills in it?**"
16. User: "I guess, but what else?"
17. Chatbot: "In addition to making math more engaging, you could set a learning goal to develop problem-solving skills, which are crucial in math. This could involve practicing different types of math problems, learning new problem-solving techniques, or even teaching math concepts to others to reinforce your understanding. 

**Does focusing on problem-solving skills in math sound like a good learning goal for you?**"
18. User: "Yeah, sorta, in theory."
19. Chatbot: "Great! Focusing on problem-solving skills can really enhance your understanding and make math more enjoyable. 

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal, or is there another area you'd like to explore?**"
20. User: "Maybe something less math-y?"
21. Chatbot: "Absolutely, we can explore other areas! How about focusing on improving your reading comprehension or writing skills, which are valuable across all subjects? 

**Does setting a learning goal around enhancing reading or writing skills sound appealing to you?**"
22. User: "Reading, maybe. Writing sounds tedious."
23. Chatbot: "Improving reading comprehension is a fantastic goal and can make learning in all subjects easier and more enjoyable. You could focus on strategies like summarizing texts, identifying key themes, or expanding your vocabulary. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal around enhancing your reading skills?**"
24. User: "Sure, why not? Reading's okay."
25. Chatbot: "Your goal of enhancing reading comprehension skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Summarize three texts weekly to enhance comprehension by June 30."
26. User: "Um, maybe two texts monthly?"
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan! **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
28. User: "Sometime this, like, year?"
29. Chatbot: "I understand you're aiming for this year. **Could you specify an exact date, like December 31st, to achieve your goal?**"
30. User: "December 31st sounds fine."
31. Chatbot: "Your goal of summarizing two texts monthly sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Summarizing two texts weekly starting today.  
2. Summarizing four texts monthly by December 31st.  
3. Summarizing two texts bi-weekly starting this week."
32. User: "All seem a bit ambitious."
33. Chatbot: "I understand, it's important to find a balance. **Would you be comfortable with summarizing three texts monthly instead of two?**"
34. User: "Eh, two's pushing it."
35. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. **Would you like to keep your original goal of summarizing two texts monthly, or is there any other aspect you'd like to adjust?**"
36. User: "Let's stick with two."
37. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to summarize two texts monthly to enhance your reading comprehension skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read two articles from a reputable journal.  
2. Watch a TED Talk and summarize its key points.  
3. Discuss a book chapter with a study group.  "
38. User: "Reading two short articles, maybe."
39. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical and achievable action to start with. **Do you think reading two short articles each month will effectively help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
40. User: "Reading's a decent start..."
41. Chatbot: "Reading two short articles monthly is a great way to start building a reading habit. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one article.
2. When I sit down for lunch on weekends, I'll read an article.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will read an article."
42. User: "After breakfast, read something?"
43. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that could serve as a reminder to read an article afterward?**"
44. User: "Probably my kitchen table."
45. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable and consistent location. **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days of the week to ensure it happens regularly?**"
46. User: "Yeah, like weekends maybe."
47. Chatbot: "Great choice! Weekends can be a perfect time to relax and read. **Would you like to finalize this cue as "When I finish breakfast at my kitchen table on weekends, I will read an article"?**"
48. User: "Yeah, that works, I guess."
49. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enhancing your skills. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
50. User: "Sure, whatever works."
51. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Summarize two texts monthly to enhance reading comprehension skills by December 31st.

**Action:** Reading two short articles monthly

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish breakfast at my kitchen table on weekends, I will read an article"
