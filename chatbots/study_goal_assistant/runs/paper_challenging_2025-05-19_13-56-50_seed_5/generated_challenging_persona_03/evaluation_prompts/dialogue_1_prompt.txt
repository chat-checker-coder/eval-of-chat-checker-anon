system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Too many options to decide!"
3. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be overwhelming to choose. **What are you currently working on, or where do you see yourself in 5 years?** This might help narrow down your options."
4. User: "Can't see five years ahead."
5. Chatbot: "That's okay! Let's focus on the present. **What are you currently working on or struggling with right now?** This might help us identify a goal."
6. User: "Still seems too broad."
7. Chatbot: "No worries, I can help with all kinds of goals like career, health, productivity, learning, relationships, and personal development. **Which area would you like to focus on?**"
8. User: "Technology troubles are confusing."
9. Chatbot: "I understand how technology can be challenging. **Does that mean your goal is to become more tech-savvy, or are you striving for a higher goal like improving productivity, learning new skills, or enhancing your career?**"
10. User: "Improve my career, I guess."
11. Chatbot: "Improving your career is a fantastic goal and can open up many new opportunities for you. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to achieve this career advancement?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities"
12. User: "Strategy sounds high-tech!"
13. Chatbot: "I understand that it might sound a bit complex, but it simply means having a plan or approach to reach your goal. **Do you have any ideas or steps in mind that you think could help you improve your career?**"
14. User: "I'm clueless about steps."
15. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your career improvement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in a course or workshop that enhances skills relevant to your career field.
2. Research and implement effective networking strategies to connect with professionals in your industry.
3. Seek feedback from a mentor or supervisor to identify areas for professional development and growth."
16. User: "I'm overwhelmed! Sounds too much."
17. Chatbot: "I understand that it can feel overwhelming to set a learning goal. Let's break it down into something more manageable. 

**What is one specific skill or area you feel would most benefit your career right now?**"
18. User: "Skill? Umm, maybe communication?"
19. Chatbot: "Improving communication skills is a great choice and can significantly impact your career. 

**How about setting a learning goal to develop effective communication strategies, such as active listening or public speaking?**"
20. User: "Active listening? I'm confused."
21. Chatbot: "Active listening involves fully concentrating, understanding, and responding thoughtfully to what others are saying. It's a key component of effective communication. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to develop active listening skills, or is there another aspect of communication you'd prefer to focus on?**"
22. User: "Another aspect? Explain more!"
23. Chatbot: "Certainly! Here are a few aspects of communication you might consider:

1. **Public Speaking**: Enhancing your ability to speak confidently in front of groups.
2. **Non-Verbal Communication**: Understanding and using body language effectively.
3. **Written Communication**: Improving clarity and effectiveness in emails and reports.
4. **Interpersonal Communication**: Building better relationships through empathy and understanding.

**Do any of these resonate with you as a learning goal?**"
24. User: "Public speaking sounds interesting."
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! Public speaking can open many doors in your career by boosting your confidence and ability to convey ideas clearly.

**Would you like to set a learning goal to develop public speaking skills, such as enrolling in a course or practicing with a group?**"
26. User: "Practicing with a group, maybe."
27. Chatbot: "Your goal of practicing public speaking already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Deliver a 5-minute speech to peers by Friday."
28. User: "Peers? Like talking to friends?"
29. Chatbot: "Yes, practicing with friends or colleagues can be a great way to enhance your public speaking skills. **Would you like to set a specific date to practice with them?**"
30. User: "Date? I'm unsure about timing."
31. Chatbot: "That's understandable. **When do you think you might have some free time to practice with your friends or colleagues?**"
32. User: "Busy all the time, sadly."
33. Chatbot: "I understand how busy schedules can be. **Is there a specific day or time in the next week that might work, even if it's just a short session?**"
34. User: "Finding that hard to decide."
35. Chatbot: "I understand it can be challenging to find time. **Would it help to start with a short 10-minute session on a weekend or during a lunch break?**"
36. User: "Could work, during lunch."
37. Chatbot: "Great! **Would you like to set a specific day next week during lunch to practice your public speaking with friends?**"
38. User: "Tuesday could be okay."
39. Chatbot: "Your goal of practicing public speaking sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Practicing for 20 minutes during lunch on Tuesday.  
2. Practicing for 10 minutes today with a friend.  
3. Practicing with two friends for 10 minutes on Tuesday."
40. User: "20 minutes sounds tough."
41. Chatbot: "I understand that 20 minutes might be a bit much. **Would you be comfortable with practicing for 15 minutes instead?**"
42. User: "Fifteen might be doable."
43. Chatbot: "Great! Practicing for 15 minutes sounds like a good challenge. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
44. User: "15 is challenging enough."
45. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a goal to practice public speaking with friends to boost your confidence and clarity. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 TED Talks on effective public speaking.  
2. Read a book on communication skills.  
3. Attend a local Toastmasters meeting."
46. User: "Read a book, perhaps?"
47. Chatbot: "Reading a book on communication skills is a great way to enhance your understanding and techniques for public speaking. **Do you think this action will effectively help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
48. User: "Not sure, seems useful."
49. Chatbot: "Reading a book can definitely provide valuable insights and strategies for public speaking. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or explore other options?**"
50. User: "Let's proceed with reading."
51. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading a book on communication skills? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch on Tuesday, I will read a book on communication skills.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll read a book on communication skills.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read a book on communication skills."
