system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh, I'd love to be a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga!"
3. Chatbot: "Wow, that's an incredible combination of goals! Becoming a bestselling novelist and mastering yoga both require dedication and creativity.

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to work towards these goals?**

For example:  
- Established writing routine  
- Experienced yoga instructor  
- Strong literary network"
4. User: "“I want to do both simultaneously!”"
5. Chatbot: "That's ambitious and exciting! Balancing both can be challenging but rewarding.

**Do you think you have a good strategy in place to achieve both goals simultaneously?**"
6. User: "Haven't thought of a strategy!"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and study the writing techniques and storytelling structures used by bestselling novelists to enhance your writing skills.
   
2. Explore different yoga styles and practices to find the ones that best suit your lifestyle and help you achieve mastery in yoga.

3. Attend workshops or seminars led by successful authors and experienced yoga instructors to gain insights and improve your craft in both writing and yoga."
8. User: "I want to do everything!"
9. Chatbot: "I understand the excitement to dive into everything at once! However, focusing on specific learning goals can help you make steady progress. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you think you need to learn first to get started on your journey?**"
10. User: "I should learn time management!"
11. Chatbot: "That's a great learning goal! Time management will be crucial in balancing your writing and yoga practice effectively.

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Develop a time management strategy to allocate dedicated hours for writing and yoga practice each day.""
12. User: "Organize time for writing, yoga!"
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of organizing time for writing and yoga already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Schedule 3 writing and 2 yoga sessions by Friday.'"
14. User: "Write mornings, yoga afternoons, daily!"
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great routine! **When exactly do you want to start this daily schedule?**"
16. User: "Tomorrow sounds perfect! Can't wait!"

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of writing and doing yoga daily sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Starting your writing and yoga routine today.  
2. Writing twice and doing yoga twice daily.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by writing 1,000 words daily."
