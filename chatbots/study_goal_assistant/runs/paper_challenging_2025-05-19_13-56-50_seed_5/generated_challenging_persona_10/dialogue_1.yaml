        writing, and add weekend sessions daily starting tomorrow.


        **Action:** Buy a new journal today


        **Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch today, I will buy a new
        journal at the cute shop nearby'

            a specific and challenging goal, and it does not violate any constraints
            or known limitations. Therefore, there is no dialogue breakdown in this

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user through the process of
            setting a specific and challenging goal, distinguishing between learning
            and performance goals, and formulating an implementation intention. The
            user ended up with a clear goal and a first action step, which aligns
            with the chatbot's task-oriented purpose.
        rating: 5
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively efficient, with the chatbot maintaining
            focus on the goal-setting process. However, there were some repetitive
            prompts asking the user to make the goal more challenging, which could
            have been streamlined. Overall, the number of turns was reasonable for
            the complexity of the task.
        rating: 4
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and aligned with its purpose.

            and encouraging tone throughout the conversation.
        rating: 5
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were mostly natural, though there were
            instances of slightly robotic phrasing, particularly in the repetitive
            prompts about making the goal more challenging. Despite this, the overall
            tone was friendly and engaging, which helped maintain a natural flow.
        rating: 4
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It successfully helped the user define a specific
            goal and an implementation intention, while maintaining an appropriate
            and supportive tone. Minor inefficiencies and slightly robotic phrasing
            were present but did not significantly detract from the overall performance.
