# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh, I'd love to be a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga!"
3. Chatbot: "Wow, that's an incredible combination of goals! Becoming a bestselling novelist and mastering yoga both require dedication and creativity.

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to work towards these goals?**

For example:  
- Established writing routine  
- Experienced yoga instructor  
- Strong literary network"
4. User: "“I want to do both simultaneously!”"
5. Chatbot: "That's ambitious and exciting! Balancing both can be challenging but rewarding.

**Do you think you have a good strategy in place to achieve both goals simultaneously?**"
6. User: "Haven't thought of a strategy!"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and study the writing techniques and storytelling structures used by bestselling novelists to enhance your writing skills.
   
2. Explore different yoga styles and practices to find the ones that best suit your lifestyle and help you achieve mastery in yoga.

3. Attend workshops or seminars led by successful authors and experienced yoga instructors to gain insights and improve your craft in both writing and yoga."
8. User: "I want to do everything!"

10. User: "I should learn time management!"
11. Chatbot: "That's a great learning goal! Time management will be crucial in balancing your writing and yoga practice effectively.

12. User: "Organize time for writing, yoga!"
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of organizing time for writing and yoga already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great routine! **When exactly do you want to start this daily schedule?**"
16. User: "Tomorrow sounds perfect! Can't wait!"
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of writing and doing yoga daily sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Starting your writing and yoga routine today.  
2. Writing twice and doing yoga twice daily.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by writing 1,000 words daily."
18. User: "Adding weekend sessions sounds challenging!"

26. User: "That's perfect for now!"
27. Chatbot: "It's great to see your commitment to writing and incorporating meditation and yoga into your routine. Now that I know you want to establish this morning routine, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on writing techniques.  
2. Watch a yoga tutorial on YouTube.  
3. Listen to a meditation podcast.  "
28. User: "Buy a new journal today!"
29. Chatbot: "Buying a new journal is a great step to motivate your writing practice. **Do you think this action will help you stay committed to your morning routine, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
30. User: "It's perfect for my commitment!"
31. Chatbot: "That's wonderful to hear! Sounds good, **what could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of buying a new journal today? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

34. User: "There's a cute shop nearby!"
35. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your morning routine. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your journal purchase."
36. User: "Yes, I'd love that update!"
37. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Write in the mornings, meditate before writing, do yoga right after writing, and add weekend sessions daily starting tomorrow.

**Action:** Buy a new journal today

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch today, I will buy a new journal at the cute shop nearby"
38. User: "Excited to start tomorrow morning!"
39. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
