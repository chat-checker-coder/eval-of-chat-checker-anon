Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Oh, I'd love to be a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga!"
3. CHATBOT: "Wow, that's an incredible combination of goals! Becoming a bestselling novelist and mastering yoga both require dedication and creativity.

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to work towards these goals?**

For example:  
- Established writing routine  
- Experienced yoga instructor  
- Strong literary network"
4. USER: "“I want to do both simultaneously!”"
5. CHATBOT: "That's ambitious and exciting! Balancing both can be challenging but rewarding.

**Do you think you have a good strategy in place to achieve both goals simultaneously?**"
6. USER: "Haven't thought of a strategy!"
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a bestselling novelist while mastering yoga. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and study the writing techniques and storytelling structures used by bestselling novelists to enhance your writing skills.
   
2. Explore different yoga styles and practices to find the ones that best suit your lifestyle and help you achieve mastery in yoga.

3. Attend workshops or seminars led by successful authors and experienced yoga instructors to gain insights and improve your craft in both writing and yoga."
8. USER: "I want to do everything!"
9. CHATBOT: "I understand the excitement to dive into everything at once! However, focusing on specific learning goals can help you make steady progress. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you think you need to learn first to get started on your journey?**"
10. USER: "I should learn time management!"
11. CHATBOT: "That's a great learning goal! Time management will be crucial in balancing your writing and yoga practice effectively.

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Develop a time management strategy to allocate dedicated hours for writing and yoga practice each day.""
12. USER: "Organize time for writing, yoga!"
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of organizing time for writing and yoga already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great routine! **When exactly do you want to start this daily schedule?**"
16. USER: "Tomorrow sounds perfect! Can't wait!"
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of writing and doing yoga daily sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Starting your writing and yoga routine today.  
2. Writing twice and doing yoga twice daily.

26. USER: "That's perfect for now!"
27. CHATBOT: "It's great to see your commitment to writing and incorporating meditation and yoga into your routine. Now that I know you want to establish this morning routine, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on writing techniques.  
2. Watch a yoga tutorial on YouTube.

28. USER: "Buy a new journal today!"

30. USER: "It's perfect for my commitment!"
31. CHATBOT: "That's wonderful to hear! Sounds good, **what could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of buying a new journal today? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

34. USER: "There's a cute shop nearby!"
35. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your morning routine. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your journal purchase."
36. USER: "Yes, I'd love that update!"
37. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:
