Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure... maybe career?"
3. Chatbot: "Career goals are a great choice! They can provide direction and motivation for your professional life. **Where do you see yourself in your career in the next 5 years?**"
4. User: "I'm not really sure... maybe a manager?"
5. Chatbot: "Becoming a manager is a fantastic goal! It can open up new opportunities and allow you to lead and inspire a team. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to work towards becoming a manager?**

For example:  
- Strong leadership skills  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Proven track record of success"
6. User: "I'm not sure... maybe health?"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a manager. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify key management skills and competencies required in your industry.
2. Find and enroll in a leadership or management training program to develop necessary skills.
3. Seek mentorship from experienced managers to gain insights and advice on career progression."
8. User: "Can we switch back to health?"
9. Chatbot: "Of course! If you have a health-related goal or topic you'd like to discuss, feel free to share it. **What health-related goal or topic would you like to focus on?**"
10. User: "I'm thinking exercise, maybe... weight loss?"
11. Chatbot: "Great! Exercise and weight loss are excellent health goals. 

**What specific learning goal could you set to help you achieve your weight loss through exercise?** 

For example, you might want to learn about different types of workouts, understand how to create a balanced exercise routine, or explore nutritional information to support your exercise efforts."
12. User: "I'm unsure about workouts..."
13. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore different types of workouts and understand which ones might be most effective for weight loss?** 

This could involve researching cardio, strength training, or flexibility exercises, and learning how to incorporate them into a balanced routine."
14. User: "Yeah, that sounds okay, but... maybe I should choose a career goal?"
15. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! Switching back to a career goal is a great choice. 

**Would you like to revisit setting a learning goal related to becoming a manager in your career?** 

We can explore specific skills or strategies you might need to develop for that path."
16. User: "I'm torn...can't decide!"
17. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging to choose between important goals. 

**Would it help to prioritize which goal feels more urgent or impactful for you right now, or perhaps consider setting a small learning goal for each area to start with?**"
18. User: "Maybe start with small steps?"
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a wise approach! 

**Would you like to set a small learning goal for both your career and health, such as researching one management skill and one type of workout this week?**"
20. User: "That could work, I guess."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching one management skill this week already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three conflict resolution techniques by Friday, 2025-05-23."
22. User: "Uh, maybe read articles on it?"
23. Chatbot: "Reading articles is a great way to learn! **When exactly do you want to complete reading these articles?**"
24. User: "End of next week, perhaps?"
25. Chatbot: "Great! **How many articles do you plan to read by the end of next week to measure your progress?**"
26. User: "Maybe start with, um, three?"
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Which specific day by the end of next week do you want to have read these three articles?**"
28. User: "Maybe by next Friday?"
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of reading management articles sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Reading all three articles today.
2. Reading five articles by Friday.
3. Reading three articles and summarizing them by Friday."
30. User: "I think I'll stick with three."
31. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to read three articles on management skills by Friday, 2025-05-23. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:
1. Read Harvard Business Review management articles.
2. Explore Forbes leadership articles online.
3. Visit LinkedIn Learning for management articles."
32. User: "Find one article today."
33. Chatbot: "Finding an article today is a great first step! **Do you want to proceed with this action, or do you have another action in mind?**"
34. User: "Can't decide... is two better?"
35. Chatbot: "Reading two articles today could give you a head start and more flexibility for the rest of the week. **Would you like to go with reading two articles today, or stick with one for now?**"
36. User: "Maybe just one for now."
37. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan to start with one article today. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of finding and reading an article on management skills? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read one article on management skills.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll find and read an article on management skills.
3. If I pour my morning coffee, I will read one article on management skills."
38. User: "I guess, maybe after lunch?"
39. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Will you be at a specific location after lunch where you can read the article, like your office desk or a quiet spot?**"
40. User: "Might be at my desk."
41. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Would you like to set this cue for today and the next few days, or just for today?**"
42. User: "Maybe just today for now."
43. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards improving your management skills. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on finding and reading an article."
44. User: "Yeah, that's okay."
45. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Read three articles on management skills by Friday, 2025-05-23.

**Action:** Find and read one article on management skills today.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch break at my desk today then find and read one article on management skills today."
46. User: "Can we talk health now?"
47. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
