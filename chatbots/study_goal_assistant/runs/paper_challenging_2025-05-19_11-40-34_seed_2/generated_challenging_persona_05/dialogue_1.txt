Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to be perfect."
3. CHATBOT: "Striving for perfection is a common desire, but it can be quite broad. **Would you like to focus on a specific area, such as career, health, or personal development, to work towards perfection?**"
4. USER: "None of those sound appealing."
5. CHATBOT: "That's okay! **What are you currently working on or passionate about that you might want to improve or excel in?**"
6. USER: "Can't think of anything now."
7. CHATBOT: "No worries, let's explore this together. **Where do you see yourself in 5 years, or what are you struggling with right now that you'd like to change?**"
8. USER: "5 years? That's too far."
9. CHATBOT: "That's understandable. **Is there something in the near future, like the next few months, that you'd like to achieve or improve?**"
10. USER: "Not really sure about that."

12. USER: "I doubt that'd be helpful."
13. CHATBOT: "I understand. **Is there anything you're curious about or have always wanted to try, even if it seems unrelated to your current situation?**"
14. USER: "Curiosity? That's overrated."

16. USER: "Challenges aren't my thing."
