system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Uh, maybe get more fit?"
3. Chatbot: "Getting more fit is a fantastic goal! It can have such a positive impact on your overall health and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular health check-ups"
4. User: "Well, I try to walk."
5. Chatbot: "Walking is a great start and can be very effective for improving fitness. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of getting more fit?**"
6. User: "Not sure. Maybe more?"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve getting more fit. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines and identify which ones align with your fitness goals.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness and overall health.
3. Study the importance of rest and recovery in a fitness regimen and how to incorporate it effectively."
8. User: "Learn about different exercises?"
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about different exercises already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five exercises for strength training by Friday."
10. User: "Uh, pick five exercises?"
11. Chatbot: "Yes, identifying five exercises is a measurable outcome. **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
12. User: "Maybe by next week?"
13. Chatbot: "Great! So, you want to identify five exercises for strength training by next week. **Could you specify an exact day, like a specific date, for achieving this goal?**"
14. User: "Um, maybe next Tuesday?"
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying five exercises for strength training by next Tuesday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying five exercises by today.  
2. Identifying ten exercises by next Tuesday.  
3. Identifying five exercises by tomorrow."
16. User: "Five exercises by tomorrow? "
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you can achieve identifying five exercises by tomorrow?**"
18. User: "I'm not so sure."
19. Chatbot: "I understand, it can be a bit daunting to speed up the timeline. **Would identifying three exercises by tomorrow be more manageable for you?**"
20. User: "Three seems easier. Let's try."
21. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three exercises for strength training by tomorrow. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube videos on strength training exercises.  
2. Read a strength training article online.  
3. Consult a fitness expert for exercise recommendations.  "
22. User: "Watch a couple videos, maybe?"
23. Chatbot: "Watching a couple of videos is a great way to learn about different strength training exercises. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
24. User: "Let's stick with videos."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching those strength training videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I'll watch strength training videos.
2. When I sit down on my couch after dinner, I'll watch strength training videos.
3. If I finish my evening walk, I'll watch strength training videos."
26. User: "After dinner, I'll watch them."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
28. User: "On my living room couch."
29. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to start this routine, or will it be every day after dinner on your living room couch?**"
30. User: "Maybe just start tonight."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards strength training. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your videos."
32. User: "I guess that's alright."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three exercises for strength training by tomorrow.

**Action:** Watch a couple of videos on strength training exercises.

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down on my living room couch after dinner tonight then watch a couple of videos on strength training exercises."
34. User: "Thanks. Hope I remember this!"
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
