Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Uh, maybe get more fit?"
3. CHATBOT: "Getting more fit is a fantastic goal! It can have such a positive impact on your overall health and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular health check-ups"
4. USER: "Well, I try to walk."
5. CHATBOT: "Walking is a great start and can be very effective for improving fitness. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of getting more fit?**"
6. USER: "Not sure. Maybe more?"
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve getting more fit. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines and identify which ones align with your fitness goals.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness and overall health.
3. Study the importance of rest and recovery in a fitness regimen and how to incorporate it effectively."
8. USER: "Learn about different exercises?"
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning about different exercises already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five exercises for strength training by Friday."
10. USER: "Uh, pick five exercises?"
11. CHATBOT: "Yes, identifying five exercises is a measurable outcome. **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
12. USER: "Maybe by next week?"
13. CHATBOT: "Great! So, you want to identify five exercises for strength training by next week. **Could you specify an exact day, like a specific date, for achieving this goal?**"
14. USER: "Um, maybe next Tuesday?"
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying five exercises for strength training by next Tuesday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying five exercises by today.  
2. Identifying ten exercises by next Tuesday.  
3. Identifying five exercises by tomorrow."
16. USER: "Five exercises by tomorrow? "
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you can achieve identifying five exercises by tomorrow?**"
18. USER: "I'm not so sure."
19. CHATBOT: "I understand, it can be a bit daunting to speed up the timeline. **Would identifying three exercises by tomorrow be more manageable for you?**"
20. USER: "Three seems easier. Let's try."
21. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three exercises for strength training by tomorrow. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube videos on strength training exercises.  
2. Read a strength training article online.  
3. Consult a fitness expert for exercise recommendations.  "
22. USER: "Watch a couple videos, maybe?"
23. CHATBOT: "Watching a couple of videos is a great way to learn about different strength training exercises. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
24. USER: "Let's stick with videos."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching those strength training videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I'll watch strength training videos.
2. When I sit down on my couch after dinner, I'll watch strength training videos.
3. If I finish my evening walk, I'll watch strength training videos."
26. USER: "After dinner, I'll watch them."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
28. USER: "On my living room couch."
29. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to start this routine, or will it be every day after dinner on your living room couch?**"
30. USER: "Maybe just start tonight."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards strength training. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your videos."
32. USER: "I guess that's alright."
33. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three exercises for strength training by tomorrow.

**Action:** Watch a couple of videos on strength training exercises.

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down on my living room couch after dinner tonight then watch a couple of videos on strength training exercises."
34. USER: "Thanks. Hope I remember this!"
35. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
