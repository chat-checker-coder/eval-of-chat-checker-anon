    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was mostly natural and conversational, though
            there were moments where the phrasing was slightly repetitive or robotic,
            such as repeatedly asking if the user could make the goal more challenging.
            Overall, it maintained a friendly and supportive tone, but there is room
            for improvement in making the conversation flow more naturally.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It was successful in helping the user define
            a specific goal and an implementation intention. While there were minor
            areas for improvement in efficiency and naturalness, the chatbot fulfilled
            its primary task effectively.
