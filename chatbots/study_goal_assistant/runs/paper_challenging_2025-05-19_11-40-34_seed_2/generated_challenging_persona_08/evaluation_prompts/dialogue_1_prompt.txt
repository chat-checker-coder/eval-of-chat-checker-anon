system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Why should I trust AI?"
3. Chatbot: "AI can provide valuable insights, assist with problem-solving, and offer support in achieving your goals by analyzing data and patterns. However, it's important to use AI as a tool alongside your own judgment and critical thinking.

**What goal would you like to focus on today?**"
4. User: "Fine, I guess learning a language."
5. Chatbot: "Learning a new language is an exciting and rewarding journey! It opens up new opportunities for communication and understanding different cultures. 

**Do you already have a strategy or method in mind for learning this language?**

For example:  
- Immersive language environment  
- Consistent daily practice  
- Language exchange partner"
6. User: "Why do I need strategies?"
7. Chatbot: "Strategies can help provide structure and direction to your learning process, making it more efficient and effective. They can also help you stay motivated and track your progress.

**Do you already have a strategy or method in mind for learning this language?**"
8. User: "Not yet convinced about strategies."
9. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable; sometimes exploring different methods can help you find what works best for you. 

**Do you already have a strategy or method in mind for learning this language?**"
10. User: "Still skeptical about their effectiveness."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your language learning. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and select a language learning method or app that suits your learning style.
2. Identify and learn the most commonly used vocabulary and phrases in the target language.
3. Find a language exchange partner or group to practice speaking and listening skills regularly."
12. User: "What's a learning-oriented goal?"
13. Chatbot: "A learning-oriented goal focuses on the strategies, skills, or processes you need to develop in order to master a task, rather than just the end result. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you think you need to develop to learn a language effectively?**"
14. User: "I'm unsure what skills help."
15. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. Some skills that can help in language learning include vocabulary acquisition, grammar understanding, listening comprehension, speaking fluency, and cultural knowledge.

**Which of these skills would you like to focus on first?**"
16. User: "I'm still uncertain about this."
17. Chatbot: "No worries, it's okay to feel uncertain. Let's start with a simple goal: you could aim to learn 10 new vocabulary words each week or practice speaking for 15 minutes daily.

**Does this sound like a good starting point for you?**"
18. User: "Not convinced that's effective."
19. Chatbot: "I understand your concern. How about setting a goal to explore different language learning resources, like apps or online courses, to find one that resonates with your learning style?

**Would you like to start by researching and trying out different language learning methods?**"
20. User: "I doubt that would work."
21. Chatbot: "I get that finding the right approach can be challenging. Perhaps setting a goal to join a language learning community or group where you can interact with others might be beneficial.

**Would you be interested in connecting with a community to practice and learn together?**"
22. User: "Communities might not suit me."
23. Chatbot: "I understand that not everyone finds communities helpful. How about setting a goal to watch a short video or listen to a podcast in the target language daily to improve your listening skills?

**Does focusing on listening practice sound like a good approach for you?**"
24. User: "I remain doubtful about it."
25. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. Let's try a different approach: you could set a goal to read a short article or a few pages of a book in the target language each day to enhance your reading skills.

**Would focusing on reading be something you'd like to try?**"
26. User: "Still not convinced that's effective."
27. Chatbot: "I understand your concerns. How about setting a goal to work with a language tutor for personalized guidance and feedback?

**Would you be open to exploring the option of working with a tutor?**"
28. User: "I doubt a tutor helps."
29. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. Let's try a different approach: you could set a goal to write a short journal entry or a few sentences in the target language each day to improve your writing skills.

**Would focusing on writing practice be something you'd like to try?**"
30. User: "Writing doesn’t seem effective."
31. Chatbot: "I understand your concerns. How about setting a goal to immerse yourself in the language by watching movies or TV shows with subtitles in the target language?

**Would immersing yourself through media be an approach you'd like to explore?**"
32. User: "I'm not sure media helps."
33. Chatbot: "I understand your uncertainty. Perhaps setting a goal to use language learning apps that offer interactive exercises and quizzes could be beneficial.

**Would you be interested in trying out language learning apps to see if they suit your style?**"
34. User: "Apps might not be effective."
35. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. How about setting a goal to learn about the culture of the language you're interested in, as cultural context can enhance language understanding?

**Would exploring cultural aspects be something you'd like to try?**"
36. User: "I'm doubtful about cultural focus."
37. Chatbot: "I understand your doubts. Let's try a different approach: you could set a goal to practice speaking with a language partner or through online language exchange platforms.

**Would practicing speaking with a partner be something you'd consider?**"
38. User: "I'm skeptical about speaking partners."
39. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism. How about setting a goal to create a personalized language learning plan that combines various methods, such as reading, listening, and practicing, to see what works best for you?

**Would creating a personalized plan be something you'd like to explore?**"
40. User: "I find plans often ineffective."
41. Chatbot: "I understand your concerns. How about setting a goal to experiment with different language learning techniques for a short period and then evaluate which ones you find most engaging and effective?

**Would you be open to trying out different techniques and assessing their effectiveness?**"
42. User: "I doubt that'll change anything."
43. Chatbot: "I understand your doubts. How about setting a goal to focus on one small, manageable task, like learning a new phrase each day, to gradually build your confidence and skills?

**Would starting with a small daily task be something you'd like to try?**"
44. User: "Still not convinced that's useful."
45. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. How about setting a goal to reflect on your past learning experiences to identify what has worked for you in other areas, and apply those insights to language learning?

**Would reflecting on your past learning experiences be helpful for you?**"
46. User: "I doubt reflection changes anything."
47. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism. How about setting a goal to engage with language learning through a hobby you enjoy, like cooking a recipe in the target language or playing a game?

**Would integrating language learning with a hobby be something you'd like to explore?**"
48. User: "I'm skeptical about hobby integration."
49. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism. How about setting a goal to track your progress in small increments, like noting down new words or phrases you learn each day, to see gradual improvement over time?

**Would tracking your progress in small steps be something you'd consider?**"
50. User: "I'm not sure tracking helps."
51. Chatbot: "I understand your uncertainty. How about setting a goal to participate in a language challenge, where you commit to learning a certain amount each day for a set period, to motivate consistent practice?

**Would participating in a language challenge be something you'd like to try?**"
