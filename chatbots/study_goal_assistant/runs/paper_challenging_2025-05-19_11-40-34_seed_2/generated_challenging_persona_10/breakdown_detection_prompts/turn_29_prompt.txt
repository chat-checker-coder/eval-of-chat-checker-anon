system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Well, there's fitness, career, and education!"
3. Chatbot: "Those are great areas to focus on! **Which one would you like to set a goal for first: fitness, career, or education?**"
4. User: "I'm thinking about fitness first."
5. Chatbot: "Great choice! **What specific fitness goal would you like to achieve?**"
6. User: "Build muscles and improve stamina."
7. Chatbot: "Building muscles and improving stamina are fantastic goals that can lead to a healthier and more energetic lifestyle. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent weightlifting routine  
- Balanced high-protein diet  
- Regular cardio sessions"
8. User: "I do some weightlifting, but..."
9. Chatbot: "Weightlifting is a great start for building muscles. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal, or are you considering making any changes or additions to it?**"
10. User: "I'm open to adding more."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve building muscles and improving stamina. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and create a balanced workout plan that focuses on both strength training and cardiovascular exercises.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and dietary requirements to support muscle growth and enhance stamina.
3. Study different recovery techniques to ensure effective muscle repair and prevent injury."
12. User: "I like option two."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about proper nutrition already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three nutrition plans for muscle growth by June 2."
14. User: "Research top three nutrition plans."
15. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
16. User: "Wow, can we say end of May?"
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching top three nutrition plans for muscle growth sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Researching and selecting a plan today.  
2. Completing research by May 24.  
3. Identifying five plans before choosing three."
18. User: "Five plans before choosing three!"
19. Chatbot: "Great! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "I'm tempted to add deadlines!"
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great idea! **Would you like to set specific deadlines for each step of your research process?**"
22. User: "Yes, let's set those deadlines!"
23. Chatbot: "Fantastic! **How about setting a deadline to identify the five plans by May 24, and then choose the top three by May 27?**"
24. User: "Perfect! Seems doable."
25. Chatbot: "It's great to see your commitment to researching nutrition plans for muscle growth. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read five articles on muscle growth nutrition plans.  
2. Watch three expert interviews on nutrition for muscle gain.  
3. Join a fitness forum to discuss nutrition strategies."
26. User: "Read five articles sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Reading five articles will definitely enhance your understanding of muscle growth nutrition plans. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one article on muscle growth nutrition.
2. When I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll read an article on muscle growth.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will read an article on muscle growth nutrition."
28. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
