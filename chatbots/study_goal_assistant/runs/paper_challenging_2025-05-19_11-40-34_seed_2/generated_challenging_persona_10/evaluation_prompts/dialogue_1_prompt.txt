system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Well, there's fitness, career, and education!"
3. Chatbot: "Those are great areas to focus on! **Which one would you like to set a goal for first: fitness, career, or education?**"
4. User: "I'm thinking about fitness first."
5. Chatbot: "Great choice! **What specific fitness goal would you like to achieve?**"
6. User: "Build muscles and improve stamina."
7. Chatbot: "Building muscles and improving stamina are fantastic goals that can lead to a healthier and more energetic lifestyle. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent weightlifting routine  
- Balanced high-protein diet  
- Regular cardio sessions"
8. User: "I do some weightlifting, but..."
9. Chatbot: "Weightlifting is a great start for building muscles. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal, or are you considering making any changes or additions to it?**"
10. User: "I'm open to adding more."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve building muscles and improving stamina. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and create a balanced workout plan that focuses on both strength training and cardiovascular exercises.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and dietary requirements to support muscle growth and enhance stamina.
3. Study different recovery techniques to ensure effective muscle repair and prevent injury."
12. User: "I like option two."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about proper nutrition already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three nutrition plans for muscle growth by June 2."
14. User: "Research top three nutrition plans."
15. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
16. User: "Wow, can we say end of May?"
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching top three nutrition plans for muscle growth sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Researching and selecting a plan today.  
2. Completing research by May 24.  
3. Identifying five plans before choosing three."
18. User: "Five plans before choosing three!"
19. Chatbot: "Great! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "I'm tempted to add deadlines!"
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great idea! **Would you like to set specific deadlines for each step of your research process?**"
22. User: "Yes, let's set those deadlines!"
23. Chatbot: "Fantastic! **How about setting a deadline to identify the five plans by May 24, and then choose the top three by May 27?**"
24. User: "Perfect! Seems doable."
25. Chatbot: "It's great to see your commitment to researching nutrition plans for muscle growth. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read five articles on muscle growth nutrition plans.  
2. Watch three expert interviews on nutrition for muscle gain.  
3. Join a fitness forum to discuss nutrition strategies."
26. User: "Read five articles sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Reading five articles will definitely enhance your understanding of muscle growth nutrition plans. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one article on muscle growth nutrition.
2. When I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll read an article on muscle growth.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will read an article on muscle growth nutrition."
28. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
29. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! Finishing your morning coffee is a reliable and noticeable event. **Do you have a specific location where you usually finish your morning coffee?**"
30. User: "I finish it in the kitchen."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! The kitchen is a clear and consistent location. Your implementation intention could be: "When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will read five articles on muscle growth nutrition plans." **Does this sound good to you?**"
32. User: "Sure, let's go with that!"
33. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your muscle growth goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
34. User: "How about we prioritize something else?"
35. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research five nutrition plans for muscle growth by May 24, and choose the top three by May 27.

**Action:** Read five articles on muscle growth nutrition plans.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will read five articles on muscle growth nutrition plans."
36. User: "Thanks, let’s switch topics!"
37. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
