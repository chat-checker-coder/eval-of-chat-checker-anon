**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but what about projects?"
7. CHATBOT: "Exploring certifications and working on projects is a solid strategy for advancing in your tech career! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for advancing in your tech career?**

For Example:
1. Earn AWS Certified Solutions Architect by June 2024.
2. Complete three tech projects by December 2023.
3. Obtain Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer certification."
8. USER: "Complete two open-source projects."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing two open-source projects already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete two open-source projects by December 31, 2025.'"
10. USER: "By December 31, 2024."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing two open-source projects sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Completing two projects by June 30, 2025.
2. Finishing one project by September 30, 2025.
3. Increasing difficulty by contributing to three projects."
12. USER: "Two projects by June 2024."
13. CHATBOT: "Completing two open-source projects by June 2024 is indeed more challenging. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. USER: "That's the right level."
15. CHATBOT: "Completing two open-source projects by June 2024 is a fantastic goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Contribute to open-source projects weekly.  
2. Attend open-source community meetups monthly.  
3. Follow tutorials on open-source development.  "
16. USER: "Research potential open-source projects."
17. CHATBOT: "Researching potential open-source projects is a great starting point! **Do you think this action will help you identify projects that align with your skills and interests?**"
18. USER: "Yes, it's a necessary step."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a necessary and productive step! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of researching potential open-source projects? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research potential open-source projects.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll explore open-source project opportunities.
3. If I sit down at my home desk after dinner, I will look for open-source projects."
20. USER: "I finish my morning coffee."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually finish your morning coffee** that could help make this cue more concrete?"
22. USER: "At my kitchen table."
23. CHATBOT: "Great! Finishing your morning coffee at your kitchen table is a clear and specific cue. **Would you like me to set this as your implementation intention?**"
24. USER: "Any other ways to track?"
25. CHATBOT: "You could also consider keeping a journal or notebook at your kitchen table to jot down your research progress right after finishing your coffee. **Would you like to proceed with the implementation intention using the kitchen table cue?**"
26. USER: "Yes, let's use that cue."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your projects. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
28. USER: "This sounds good. Thanks."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete two open-source projects by June 2024.

**Action:** Research potential open-source projects

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at my kitchen table then research potential open-source projects"
