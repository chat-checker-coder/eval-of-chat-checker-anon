            which aligns with the chatbot's purpose of guiding the user in goal setting.
            The question about the user's current strategy is appropriate and encourages
            the user to think about their current approach, which is a logical next
            step in the goal-setting process. There are no breakdowns in terms of

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot acknowledges the user's current strategy of exploring
            certifications and provides positive reinforcement, which is appropriate.
            However, the follow-up question "Do you think this strategy is already
            a good strategy to achieve your goal?" is somewhat redundant and lacks
            clarity. The user has already indicated they are exploring certifications,
            implying they see it as a potentially good strategy. The chatbot should
            instead focus on helping the user develop a specific plan or next steps
            related to certifications, such as identifying which certifications to
            pursue or setting a timeline. This would align better with the chatbot's
            task of guiding the user in formulating a specific goal and action plan.
            Therefore, the chatbot's response leads to a minor breakdown due to lack
