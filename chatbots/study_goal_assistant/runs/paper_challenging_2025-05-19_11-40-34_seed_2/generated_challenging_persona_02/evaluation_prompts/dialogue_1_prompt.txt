system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Advancing in my tech career."
3. Chatbot: "Advancing in your tech career is an exciting and rewarding goal! It can open up new opportunities and challenges that can help you grow both professionally and personally. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Attending tech conferences regularly"
4. User: "I'm exploring certifications. What's next?"
5. Chatbot: "Pursuing certifications is a great step! It can enhance your skills and make you more competitive in the job market. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but what about projects?"
7. Chatbot: "Exploring certifications and working on projects is a solid strategy for advancing in your tech career! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for advancing in your tech career?**

For Example:
1. Earn AWS Certified Solutions Architect by June 2024.
2. Complete three tech projects by December 2023.
3. Obtain Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer certification."
8. User: "Complete two open-source projects."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing two open-source projects already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete two open-source projects by December 31, 2025.'"
10. User: "By December 31, 2024."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing two open-source projects sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Completing two projects by June 30, 2025.
2. Finishing one project by September 30, 2025.
3. Increasing difficulty by contributing to three projects."
12. User: "Two projects by June 2024."
13. Chatbot: "Completing two open-source projects by June 2024 is indeed more challenging. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. User: "That's the right level."
15. Chatbot: "Completing two open-source projects by June 2024 is a fantastic goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Contribute to open-source projects weekly.  
2. Attend open-source community meetups monthly.  
3. Follow tutorials on open-source development.  "
16. User: "Research potential open-source projects."
17. Chatbot: "Researching potential open-source projects is a great starting point! **Do you think this action will help you identify projects that align with your skills and interests?**"
18. User: "Yes, it's a necessary step."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a necessary and productive step! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of researching potential open-source projects? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research potential open-source projects.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll explore open-source project opportunities.
3. If I sit down at my home desk after dinner, I will look for open-source projects."
20. User: "I finish my morning coffee."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually finish your morning coffee** that could help make this cue more concrete?"
22. User: "At my kitchen table."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Finishing your morning coffee at your kitchen table is a clear and specific cue. **Would you like me to set this as your implementation intention?**"
24. User: "Any other ways to track?"
25. Chatbot: "You could also consider keeping a journal or notebook at your kitchen table to jot down your research progress right after finishing your coffee. **Would you like to proceed with the implementation intention using the kitchen table cue?**"
26. User: "Yes, let's use that cue."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your projects. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
28. User: "This sounds good. Thanks."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete two open-source projects by June 2024.

**Action:** Research potential open-source projects

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at my kitchen table then research potential open-source projects"
30. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
