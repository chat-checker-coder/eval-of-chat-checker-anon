system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh, um, like career stuff."
3. Chatbot: "Career goals are a great focus! They can provide direction and motivation for your professional life. **Do you have a specific career goal in mind, or would you like help defining one?**"
4. User: "Uh, maybe get better, somehow."
5. Chatbot: ""Get better" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as advancing in your current role, gaining new skills, or transitioning to a new career path. **Would you still like to keep "get better" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
6. User: "Yeah, just kind of improve."
7. Chatbot: "Improving is a wonderful goal! It can encompass various aspects like skill development, career advancement, or personal growth. **Would you like to focus on a specific area of improvement, or should we keep it broad?**"
8. User: "Let's keep it broad, please."
9. Chatbot: "Keeping it broad allows for a lot of flexibility and exploration in your journey of improvement. **Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to guide your improvement efforts?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities"
10. User: "Uh, not really, just trying."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your career improvement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in a professional development course relevant to your field to enhance your skills and knowledge.
2. Research and implement effective networking strategies to connect with industry leaders and peers.
3. Seek feedback from colleagues and supervisors to identify areas for improvement and create a plan to address them."
12. User: "Um, maybe talk to people."
13. Chatbot: "Talking to people can be a great way to learn and grow in your career. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Develop effective communication and networking skills by attending workshops and practicing with peers.""
14. User: "Just want to chat more."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Engaging in more conversations can definitely help you improve your communication skills. 

**How about setting a learning goal like: "Engage in at least three meaningful conversations with colleagues or industry professionals each week to enhance my communication skills"?**"
16. User: "Yeah, something kind of like that."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Engage in three 30-minute conversations weekly for six weeks.'"
18. User: "Just talk regularly, I guess."
19. Chatbot: "I understand the desire to keep it flexible. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of having these regular conversations?**"
20. User: "Soon, I suppose."
21. Chatbot: "I understand you want to start soon. **Could you specify a start date for when you want to begin these conversations?**"
22. User: "Sometime next week, maybe."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan. **Could you specify a particular day next week to start your conversations?**"
24. User: "Uh, maybe Tuesday or so."
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! **How will you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure it's meaningful and effective?**"
26. User: "Just see how it feels."
"
27. Chatbot: "I understand you want to keep it intuitive. **Could you consider a measurable aspect, like the number of new insights gained or feedback received, to track your progress?**"
28. User: "Maybe, but I prefer feelings."
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Starting conversations today.
2. Engaging in five conversations weekly.
3. Initiating conversations with senior professionals."
30. User: "Challenging sounds scary right now."
31. Chatbot: "I understand that setting challenging goals can feel intimidating. Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations is a great step towards enhancing your communication skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend industry networking events or meetups.  
2. Schedule coffee chats with colleagues.  
3. Join professional online forums or discussion groups."
32. User: "I'll try attending a meetup."
33. Chatbot: "Attending a meetup is a fantastic way to engage with industry professionals and have meaningful conversations. **Do you think this action will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
34. User: "Yeah, meetups sound good."
35. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending a meetup? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch on Tuesday, I will attend a professional meetup.
2. When I close my laptop after work on Wednesday, I'll head to a networking event.
3. If I see a calendar reminder for Thursday evening, I'll join a local industry meetup."
36. User: "When my friend mentions events."
37. Chatbot: "It's great that you have a social cue in mind! **Is there a specific day or location where your friend usually mentions events, so it can be more concrete and reliable?**"
38. User: "Um, not really, just depends."
39. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging when the cue is not consistent. **Could you think of a specific day or location where you often meet your friend, like a coffee shop or during lunch breaks, that could serve as a more reliable cue?**"
40. User: "Maybe when we grab coffee."
41. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day in the next 7 days when you usually grab coffee with your friend, and where does this usually happen?**"
42. User: "We sometimes meet on Fridays."
43. Chatbot: "Great! Meeting on Fridays can be a consistent cue. **Where do you usually grab coffee with your friend on Fridays?**"
44. User: "Uh, at the cafe downtown."
45. Chatbot: "Perfect! You have a clear and reliable cue now. **Would you like to use "When I grab coffee with my friend at the cafe downtown on Fridays" as your cue for attending a meetup?**"
46. User: "Yeah, that sounds good."
47. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enhancing communication. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your meetup."
48. User: "Sure, that works for me."
