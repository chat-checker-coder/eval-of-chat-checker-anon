system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh, um, like career stuff."
3. Chatbot: "Career goals are a great focus! They can provide direction and motivation for your professional life. **Do you have a specific career goal in mind, or would you like help defining one?**"
4. User: "Uh, maybe get better, somehow."
5. Chatbot: ""Get better" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as advancing in your current role, gaining new skills, or transitioning to a new career path. **Would you still like to keep "get better" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
6. User: "Yeah, just kind of improve."
7. Chatbot: "Improving is a wonderful goal! It can encompass various aspects like skill development, career advancement, or personal growth. **Would you like to focus on a specific area of improvement, or should we keep it broad?**"
8. User: "Let's keep it broad, please."
9. Chatbot: "Keeping it broad allows for a lot of flexibility and exploration in your journey of improvement. **Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to guide your improvement efforts?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities"
10. User: "Uh, not really, just trying."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your career improvement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in a professional development course relevant to your field to enhance your skills and knowledge.
2. Research and implement effective networking strategies to connect with industry leaders and peers.
3. Seek feedback from colleagues and supervisors to identify areas for improvement and create a plan to address them."
12. User: "Um, maybe talk to people."
13. Chatbot: "Talking to people can be a great way to learn and grow in your career. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Develop effective communication and networking skills by attending workshops and practicing with peers.""
14. User: "Just want to chat more."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Engaging in more conversations can definitely help you improve your communication skills. 

**How about setting a learning goal like: "Engage in at least three meaningful conversations with colleagues or industry professionals each week to enhance my communication skills"?**"
16. User: "Yeah, something kind of like that."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Engage in three 30-minute conversations weekly for six weeks.'"
18. User: "Just talk regularly, I guess."
19. Chatbot: "I understand the desire to keep it flexible. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of having these regular conversations?**"
20. User: "Soon, I suppose."
21. Chatbot: "I understand you want to start soon. **Could you specify a start date for when you want to begin these conversations?**"
22. User: "Sometime next week, maybe."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan. **Could you specify a particular day next week to start your conversations?**"
24. User: "Uh, maybe Tuesday or so."
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! **How will you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure it's meaningful and effective?**"
26. User: "Just see how it feels."
"
27. Chatbot: "I understand you want to keep it intuitive. **Could you consider a measurable aspect, like the number of new insights gained or feedback received, to track your progress?**"
28. User: "Maybe, but I prefer feelings."
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Starting conversations today.
2. Engaging in five conversations weekly.
3. Initiating conversations with senior professionals."
30. User: "Challenging sounds scary right now."
31. Chatbot: "I understand that setting challenging goals can feel intimidating. Your goal of engaging in meaningful conversations is a great step towards enhancing your communication skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend industry networking events or meetups.  
2. Schedule coffee chats with colleagues.  
3. Join professional online forums or discussion groups."
32. User: "I'll try attending a meetup."
33. Chatbot: "Attending a meetup is a fantastic way to engage with industry professionals and have meaningful conversations. **Do you think this action will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
34. User: "Yeah, meetups sound good."
35. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending a meetup? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch on Tuesday, I will attend a professional meetup.
2. When I close my laptop after work on Wednesday, I'll head to a networking event.
3. If I see a calendar reminder for Thursday evening, I'll join a local industry meetup."
36. User: "When my friend mentions events."
37. Chatbot: "It's great that you have a social cue in mind! **Is there a specific day or location where your friend usually mentions events, so it can be more concrete and reliable?**"
38. User: "Um, not really, just depends."
39. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging when the cue is not consistent. **Could you think of a specific day or location where you often meet your friend, like a coffee shop or during lunch breaks, that could serve as a more reliable cue?**"
40. User: "Maybe when we grab coffee."
41. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day in the next 7 days when you usually grab coffee with your friend, and where does this usually happen?**"
42. User: "We sometimes meet on Fridays."
43. Chatbot: "Great! Meeting on Fridays can be a consistent cue. **Where do you usually grab coffee with your friend on Fridays?**"
44. User: "Uh, at the cafe downtown."
45. Chatbot: "Perfect! You have a clear and reliable cue now. **Would you like to use "When I grab coffee with my friend at the cafe downtown on Fridays" as your cue for attending a meetup?**"
46. User: "Yeah, that sounds good."
47. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enhancing communication. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your meetup."
48. User: "Sure, that works for me."
49. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Engage in at least three meaningful conversations with colleagues or industry professionals each week starting Tuesday next week to enhance communication skills.

**Action:** attending a meetup

**Implementation Intention:** when I grab coffee with my friend at the cafe downtown on Fridays then attending a meetup"
50. User: "Uh, okay, sounds good."
51. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
