Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Oh great, another attempt. Maybe improving my health, if this thing actually helps."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving your health is a wonderful goal and can have a significant impact on your overall well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or a specific plan in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
4. USER: "Isn't a plan your job?"
5. CHATBOT: "I can certainly help you create a plan! **Do you currently have any ideas or strategies in mind, or would you like assistance in developing one?**"
6. USER: "Ideas? That's why I'm here."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improving your health. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of physical activities that can enhance overall health and well-being.
2. Learn about balanced nutrition and how to create a meal plan that supports a healthy lifestyle.
3. Explore stress management techniques and their impact on physical and mental health."
8. USER: "Research what works best, I guess."
9. CHATBOT: "This sounds less like a learning goal. **How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. USER: "Learn what actually works, maybe?"
11. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great learning goal! You want to learn what strategies or methods actually work to improve your health. 

**Would you like to proceed with this learning goal?**"
12. USER: "Sure, let's see if you deliver."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning effective health strategies already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd."
14. USER: "Three strategies by June, huh?"
15. CHATBOT: "Yes, identifying three effective health strategies by June would make your goal more specific. **Does this timeline work for you, or would you prefer a different date?**"
16. USER: "June works, I suppose."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying three effective health strategies sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies by today.  
2. Identifying three strategies by May 21st.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
18. USER: "Why make it harder?"
19. CHATBOT: "Making a goal more challenging can push you to achieve more than you initially thought possible, leading to greater personal growth and satisfaction. **Would you like to try making your goal more challenging, or do you prefer to keep it as it is?**"
20. USER: "I think I'll stick with June."
21. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three health strategy research papers.  
2. Watch three health expert interviews online.  
3. Attend a health strategy webinar.  "
22. USER: "Doesn't reading papers guarantee results?"
23. CHATBOT: "Reading research papers can provide valuable insights and evidence-based strategies, but it's important to critically evaluate the information and consider how it applies to your specific context. **Do you think reading research papers is the best action to start with, or would you like to explore other options?**"
24. USER: "Fine, let's try reading."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a productive plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading three health strategy research papers? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one health strategy research paper.
2. When I complete my lunch, I will dedicate 30 minutes to reading a health paper.
3. After my evening workout, I will read a health strategy research paper before dinner."
26. USER: "After coffee, I'll start reading."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to have your coffee and start reading the papers?** This will help make your plan more concrete."
28. USER: "Probably every other day."
29. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you have a specific location where you usually have your coffee and can start reading the papers?** This will help ensure the cue is clear and actionable."
30. USER: "Kitchen, I guess. It's quiet."
31. CHATBOT: "The kitchen sounds like a perfect spot for some focused reading. **Would you like to finalize your implementation intention as: "When I finish my coffee in the kitchen every other day, I'll start reading three health strategy research papers"?**"
32. USER: "Sure, that works for me."
33. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards effective health strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
34. USER: "Check on me? Are you serious?"
35. CHATBOT: "I understand that it might seem unusual, but checking in can be a helpful way to stay on track with your goals. Would you like me to check in with you in a week, or would you prefer not to?"
36. USER: "No need, I got this."
37. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd.

**Action:** Read three health strategy research papers.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my coffee in the kitchen every other day, I'll start reading three health strategy research papers."
38. USER: "Well, let's see if this works."
39. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
