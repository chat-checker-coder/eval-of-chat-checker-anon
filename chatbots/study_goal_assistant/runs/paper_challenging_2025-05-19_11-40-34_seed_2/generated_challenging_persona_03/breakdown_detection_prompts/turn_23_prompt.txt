system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh great, another attempt. Maybe improving my health, if this thing actually helps."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your health is a wonderful goal and can have a significant impact on your overall well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or a specific plan in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
4. User: "Isn't a plan your job?"
5. Chatbot: "I can certainly help you create a plan! **Do you currently have any ideas or strategies in mind, or would you like assistance in developing one?**"
6. User: "Ideas? That's why I'm here."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improving your health. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of physical activities that can enhance overall health and well-being.
2. Learn about balanced nutrition and how to create a meal plan that supports a healthy lifestyle.
3. Explore stress management techniques and their impact on physical and mental health."
8. User: "Research what works best, I guess."
9. Chatbot: "This sounds less like a learning goal. **How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "Learn what actually works, maybe?"
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great learning goal! You want to learn what strategies or methods actually work to improve your health. 

**Would you like to proceed with this learning goal?**"
12. User: "Sure, let's see if you deliver."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning effective health strategies already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd."
14. User: "Three strategies by June, huh?"
15. Chatbot: "Yes, identifying three effective health strategies by June would make your goal more specific. **Does this timeline work for you, or would you prefer a different date?**"
16. User: "June works, I suppose."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three effective health strategies sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies by today.  
2. Identifying three strategies by May 21st.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
18. User: "Why make it harder?"
19. Chatbot: "Making a goal more challenging can push you to achieve more than you initially thought possible, leading to greater personal growth and satisfaction. **Would you like to try making your goal more challenging, or do you prefer to keep it as it is?**"
20. User: "I think I'll stick with June."
21. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three health strategy research papers.  
2. Watch three health expert interviews online.  
3. Attend a health strategy webinar.  "
22. User: "Doesn't reading papers guarantee results?"

23. Chatbot: "Reading research papers can provide valuable insights and evidence-based strategies, but it's important to critically evaluate the information and consider how it applies to your specific context. **Do you think reading research papers is the best action to start with, or would you like to explore other options?**"
