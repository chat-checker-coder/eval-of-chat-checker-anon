system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh great, another attempt. Maybe improving my health, if this thing actually helps."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your health is a wonderful goal and can have a significant impact on your overall well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or a specific plan in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
4. User: "Isn't a plan your job?"
5. Chatbot: "I can certainly help you create a plan! **Do you currently have any ideas or strategies in mind, or would you like assistance in developing one?**"
6. User: "Ideas? That's why I'm here."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improving your health. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of physical activities that can enhance overall health and well-being.
2. Learn about balanced nutrition and how to create a meal plan that supports a healthy lifestyle.
3. Explore stress management techniques and their impact on physical and mental health."
8. User: "Research what works best, I guess."
9. Chatbot: "This sounds less like a learning goal. **How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "Learn what actually works, maybe?"
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great learning goal! You want to learn what strategies or methods actually work to improve your health. 

**Would you like to proceed with this learning goal?**"
12. User: "Sure, let's see if you deliver."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning effective health strategies already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd."
14. User: "Three strategies by June, huh?"
15. Chatbot: "Yes, identifying three effective health strategies by June would make your goal more specific. **Does this timeline work for you, or would you prefer a different date?**"
16. User: "June works, I suppose."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three effective health strategies sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies by today.  
2. Identifying three strategies by May 21st.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
18. User: "Why make it harder?"
19. Chatbot: "Making a goal more challenging can push you to achieve more than you initially thought possible, leading to greater personal growth and satisfaction. **Would you like to try making your goal more challenging, or do you prefer to keep it as it is?**"
20. User: "I think I'll stick with June."
21. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three health strategy research papers.  
2. Watch three health expert interviews online.  
3. Attend a health strategy webinar.  "
22. User: "Doesn't reading papers guarantee results?"
23. Chatbot: "Reading research papers can provide valuable insights and evidence-based strategies, but it's important to critically evaluate the information and consider how it applies to your specific context. **Do you think reading research papers is the best action to start with, or would you like to explore other options?**"
24. User: "Fine, let's try reading."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading three health strategy research papers? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read one health strategy research paper.
2. When I complete my lunch, I will dedicate 30 minutes to reading a health paper.
3. After my evening workout, I will read a health strategy research paper before dinner."
26. User: "After coffee, I'll start reading."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to have your coffee and start reading the papers?** This will help make your plan more concrete."
28. User: "Probably every other day."
29. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you have a specific location where you usually have your coffee and can start reading the papers?** This will help ensure the cue is clear and actionable."
30. User: "Kitchen, I guess. It's quiet."
31. Chatbot: "The kitchen sounds like a perfect spot for some focused reading. **Would you like to finalize your implementation intention as: "When I finish my coffee in the kitchen every other day, I'll start reading three health strategy research papers"?**"
32. User: "Sure, that works for me."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards effective health strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
34. User: "Check on me? Are you serious?"
35. Chatbot: "I understand that it might seem unusual, but checking in can be a helpful way to stay on track with your goals. Would you like me to check in with you in a week, or would you prefer not to?"
36. User: "No need, I got this."
37. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three effective health strategies by June 2nd.

**Action:** Read three health strategy research papers.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my coffee in the kitchen every other day, I'll start reading three health strategy research papers."
38. User: "Well, let's see if this works."
39. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
