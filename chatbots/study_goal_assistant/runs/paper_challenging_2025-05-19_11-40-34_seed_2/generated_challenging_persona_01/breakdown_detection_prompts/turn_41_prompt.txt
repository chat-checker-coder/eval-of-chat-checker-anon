system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Learn a new skill. Quickly."
3. Chatbot: ""Learn a new skill quickly" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing your career, improving personal development, or increasing productivity. **Would you still like to keep "learn a new skill quickly" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, keep it simple."
5. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic choice! Learning a new skill quickly can open up so many opportunities and boost your confidence.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use spaced repetition techniques  
- Set specific, achievable goals  
- Practice consistently and regularly"
6. User: "Just get to it. Fast."
7. Chatbot: "It sounds like you might not have a specific strategy in mind yet. 

**Do you think this approach is a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Whatever works quickly. Suggest something."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify effective learning techniques that can accelerate skill acquisition.
2. Find and utilize online resources or courses that offer structured learning paths for the skill you want to learn.
3. Practice time management strategies to allocate dedicated time for focused and consistent practice of the new skill."
10. User: "Just want quick results. Ideas?"
11. Chatbot: "I understand the desire for quick results, but focusing on learning strategies can lead to more sustainable success. 

**How could you formulate a learning goal that focuses on acquiring the skill efficiently?**"
12. User: "Something easy and effective."
13. Chatbot: "I understand the need for simplicity and effectiveness. 

**How about setting a learning goal to identify and practice the top three techniques that are known to quickly enhance the skill you want to learn?**"
14. User: "Fine. Recommend top three techniques."
15. Chatbot: "Here are three techniques that are often effective for quickly learning a new skill:

1. **Focused Practice**: Dedicate short, intense periods of time to practice the skill without distractions.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Use spaced repetition to reinforce learning over time, which helps in retaining information.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Regularly seek feedback and make adjustments to improve your performance.

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal?**"
16. User: "Sure, sounds efficient enough."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying and practicing techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three techniques to enhance coding skills by June 2."
18. User: "Master three techniques by June."
19. Chatbot: "I see you've set a time frame for June. **How could you measure the outcome of mastering these techniques?**"
20. User: "Not sure, just see improvement."
21. Chatbot: "I understand wanting to see improvement. **Could you specify a particular skill or area where you'd like to see this improvement, such as improving your coding speed or accuracy?**"
22. User: "Improve speed, accuracy by June."
23. Chatbot: "Great! **Could you specify a measurable target for your speed and accuracy improvement by June, like completing a coding task in a certain amount of time or reducing errors by a specific percentage?**"
24. User: "Finish tasks 20% faster."
25. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering techniques to improve coding speed and accuracy sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Mastering one technique by next Monday.  
2. Finishing tasks 30% faster by June.  
3. Identifying five techniques before choosing three."
26. User: "30% faster by June. Done."
27. Chatbot: "Great! You've made your goal more challenging by aiming to finish tasks 30% faster by June. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
28. User: "Right level. Let's proceed."
29. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to master techniques for improving coding speed and accuracy. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Complete an online course on coding efficiency.  
2. Read a book on advanced coding techniques.  
3. Practice coding challenges on competitive programming platforms."
30. User: "Complete a course on efficiency."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to take! **Do you have a specific course in mind, or would you like recommendations on where to find one?**"
32. User: "No time for specifics. Got one?"
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive step forward! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of completing a course on efficiency? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will study a module on efficiency.
2. When I log off from work at 5 PM, I'll dedicate 30 minutes to my course.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I will complete a lesson on coding speed."
34. User: "After coffee, I study."
35. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start studying?**"
36. User: "At my kitchen table."
37. Chatbot: "Perfect! **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days within the next week?**"
38. User: "Every weekday, after coffee."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards improving your coding skills. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your course."
40. User: "No need. I'll manage."
