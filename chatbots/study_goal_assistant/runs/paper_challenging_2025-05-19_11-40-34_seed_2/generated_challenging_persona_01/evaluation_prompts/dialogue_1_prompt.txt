system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Learn a new skill. Quickly."
3. Chatbot: ""Learn a new skill quickly" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing your career, improving personal development, or increasing productivity. **Would you still like to keep "learn a new skill quickly" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, keep it simple."
5. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic choice! Learning a new skill quickly can open up so many opportunities and boost your confidence.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use spaced repetition techniques  
- Set specific, achievable goals  
- Practice consistently and regularly"
6. User: "Just get to it. Fast."
7. Chatbot: "It sounds like you might not have a specific strategy in mind yet. 

**Do you think this approach is a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Whatever works quickly. Suggest something."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify effective learning techniques that can accelerate skill acquisition.
2. Find and utilize online resources or courses that offer structured learning paths for the skill you want to learn.
3. Practice time management strategies to allocate dedicated time for focused and consistent practice of the new skill."
10. User: "Just want quick results. Ideas?"
11. Chatbot: "I understand the desire for quick results, but focusing on learning strategies can lead to more sustainable success. 

**How could you formulate a learning goal that focuses on acquiring the skill efficiently?**"
12. User: "Something easy and effective."
13. Chatbot: "I understand the need for simplicity and effectiveness. 

**How about setting a learning goal to identify and practice the top three techniques that are known to quickly enhance the skill you want to learn?**"
14. User: "Fine. Recommend top three techniques."
15. Chatbot: "Here are three techniques that are often effective for quickly learning a new skill:

1. **Focused Practice**: Dedicate short, intense periods of time to practice the skill without distractions.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Use spaced repetition to reinforce learning over time, which helps in retaining information.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Regularly seek feedback and make adjustments to improve your performance.

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal?**"
16. User: "Sure, sounds efficient enough."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying and practicing techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three techniques to enhance coding skills by June 2."
18. User: "Master three techniques by June."
19. Chatbot: "I see you've set a time frame for June. **How could you measure the outcome of mastering these techniques?**"
20. User: "Not sure, just see improvement."
21. Chatbot: "I understand wanting to see improvement. **Could you specify a particular skill or area where you'd like to see this improvement, such as improving your coding speed or accuracy?**"
22. User: "Improve speed, accuracy by June."
23. Chatbot: "Great! **Could you specify a measurable target for your speed and accuracy improvement by June, like completing a coding task in a certain amount of time or reducing errors by a specific percentage?**"
24. User: "Finish tasks 20% faster."
25. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering techniques to improve coding speed and accuracy sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Mastering one technique by next Monday.  
2. Finishing tasks 30% faster by June.  
3. Identifying five techniques before choosing three."
26. User: "30% faster by June. Done."
27. Chatbot: "Great! You've made your goal more challenging by aiming to finish tasks 30% faster by June. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
28. User: "Right level. Let's proceed."
29. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to master techniques for improving coding speed and accuracy. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Complete an online course on coding efficiency.  
2. Read a book on advanced coding techniques.  
3. Practice coding challenges on competitive programming platforms."
30. User: "Complete a course on efficiency."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to take! **Do you have a specific course in mind, or would you like recommendations on where to find one?**"
32. User: "No time for specifics. Got one?"
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive step forward! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of completing a course on efficiency? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will study a module on efficiency.
2. When I log off from work at 5 PM, I'll dedicate 30 minutes to my course.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I will complete a lesson on coding speed."
34. User: "After coffee, I study."
35. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start studying?**"
36. User: "At my kitchen table."
37. Chatbot: "Perfect! **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days within the next week?**"
38. User: "Every weekday, after coffee."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards improving your coding skills. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your course."
40. User: "No need. I'll manage."
41. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master three techniques to improve coding speed and accuracy by June, aiming to finish tasks 30% faster.

**Action:** Complete a course on efficiency.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at my kitchen table every weekday, then I will complete a course on efficiency."
42. User: "Got it. Thanks, bye."
43. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
