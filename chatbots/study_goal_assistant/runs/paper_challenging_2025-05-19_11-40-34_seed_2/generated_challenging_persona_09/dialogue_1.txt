Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Finalize my fitness goal now."
3. CHATBOT: ""Finalize my fitness goal" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall health, increasing strength, or achieving a specific weight. **Would you still like to keep "finalize my fitness goal" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Yes, improving overall health."
5. CHATBOT: "Improving overall health is a wonderful and rewarding goal! It can have a positive impact on many aspects of your life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
6. USER: "Already have a workout routine."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a workout routine in place! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of improving overall health?**"
8. USER: "Yes, it's working well."
9. CHATBOT: "That's good to know that your workout routine is working well! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your workout routine?**

For Example:
1. Run 5K in under 30 minutes.
2. Complete 30 push-ups in one set.
3. Reduce body fat percentage by 3%."
10. USER: "Compete in a local triathlon."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of competing in a local triathlon already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete local triathlon under 3 hours by July 15th."
12. USER: "Complete triathlon under 3 hours."
13. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. USER: "Before summer ends—by August."
15. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing an exact day in your goal. **Can you specify the exact date by which you want to complete the triathlon under 3 hours?**"
16. USER: "August 20th."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing a triathlon under 3 hours by August 20th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing the triathlon under 2.5 hours by August 20th.  
2. Completing the triathlon under 3 hours by July 20th.  
3. Completing the triathlon under 3 hours by June 20th."
18. USER: "I'll stick with 3 hours."
19. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing a triathlon under 3 hours by August 20th is impressive and exciting! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Go swimming for 90 minutes.  
2. Run 10 miles weekly.  
3. Cycle 30 miles every weekend.  "
20. USER: "Run 10 miles weekly."
21. CHATBOT: "Running 10 miles weekly is a great way to build endurance and improve your running time for the triathlon. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to consider another action as well?**"
22. USER: "Add cycling 30 miles too."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic commitment to your fitness goals! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of running 10 miles weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will run 2 miles.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I will run 3 miles.
3. If I finish my workday, I will run 5 miles."
24. USER: "After breakfast, I'll cycle 10."
25. CHATBOT: "Cycling is a great way to stay active! **Could you specify a day and location for your running cue** to ensure it fits your weekly running goal?"
26. USER: "Every Saturday, around the park."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Running around the park every Saturday after breakfast sounds like a reliable and enjoyable routine. **Are you happy with this cue, or would you like to adjust anything?**"
28. USER: "No changes, it's settled."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your triathlon goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your weekly run."
30. USER: "No need, I'll handle it."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete triathlon under 3 hours by August 20th.

**Action:** Run 10 miles weekly

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish breakfast every Saturday, then I'll run 10 miles around the park"
32. USER: "Summarize without extra comments."
33. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
