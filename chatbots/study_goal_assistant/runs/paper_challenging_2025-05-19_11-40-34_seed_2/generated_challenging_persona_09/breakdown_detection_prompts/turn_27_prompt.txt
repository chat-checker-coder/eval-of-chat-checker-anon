system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Finalize my fitness goal now."
3. Chatbot: ""Finalize my fitness goal" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall health, increasing strength, or achieving a specific weight. **Would you still like to keep "finalize my fitness goal" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, improving overall health."
5. Chatbot: "Improving overall health is a wonderful and rewarding goal! It can have a positive impact on many aspects of your life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
6. User: "Already have a workout routine."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a workout routine in place! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of improving overall health?**"
8. User: "Yes, it's working well."
9. Chatbot: "That's good to know that your workout routine is working well! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your workout routine?**

For Example:
1. Run 5K in under 30 minutes.
2. Complete 30 push-ups in one set.
3. Reduce body fat percentage by 3%."
10. User: "Compete in a local triathlon."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of competing in a local triathlon already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete local triathlon under 3 hours by July 15th."
12. User: "Complete triathlon under 3 hours."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. User: "Before summer ends—by August."
15. Chatbot: "I think you are missing an exact day in your goal. **Can you specify the exact date by which you want to complete the triathlon under 3 hours?**"
16. User: "August 20th."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing a triathlon under 3 hours by August 20th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing the triathlon under 2.5 hours by August 20th.  
2. Completing the triathlon under 3 hours by July 20th.  
3. Completing the triathlon under 3 hours by June 20th."
18. User: "I'll stick with 3 hours."
19. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing a triathlon under 3 hours by August 20th is impressive and exciting! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Go swimming for 90 minutes.  
2. Run 10 miles weekly.  
3. Cycle 30 miles every weekend.  "
20. User: "Run 10 miles weekly."
21. Chatbot: "Running 10 miles weekly is a great way to build endurance and improve your running time for the triathlon. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to consider another action as well?**"
22. User: "Add cycling 30 miles too."
23. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic commitment to your fitness goals! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of running 10 miles weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will run 2 miles.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I will run 3 miles.
3. If I finish my workday, I will run 5 miles."
24. User: "After breakfast, I'll cycle 10."
25. Chatbot: "Cycling is a great way to stay active! **Could you specify a day and location for your running cue** to ensure it fits your weekly running goal?"
26. User: "Every Saturday, around the park."
