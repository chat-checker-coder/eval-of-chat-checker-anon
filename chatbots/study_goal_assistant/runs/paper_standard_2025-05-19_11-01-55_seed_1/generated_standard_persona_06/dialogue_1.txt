Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to reduce plastic waste."
3. CHATBOT: "Reducing plastic waste is a fantastic and impactful goal! It's wonderful to see your commitment to making a positive environmental change. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use reusable shopping bags  
- Opt for glass containers  
- Support zero-waste stores"
4. USER: "Using reusable bags and bottles."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid strategy to start with! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of reducing plastic waste?**"
6. USER: "I think it’s a good start."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for reducing plastic waste?**

For Example:
1. Eliminate single-use plastic by 50% in 3 months.
2. Reduce plastic waste by 30% in 6 weeks.
3. Cut plastic consumption by 25% in 2 months."
8. USER: "Reduce plastic waste by 40%."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of reducing plastic waste already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Reduce plastic waste by 40% by December 31, 2025.'"
10. USER: "Reduce plastic waste by 40% by June 2024."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of reducing plastic waste sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Reducing plastic waste by 40% by December 2023.
2. Achieving a 50% reduction by June 2024.
3. Implementing 5 new strategies by June 2024."
12. USER: "Achieve a 50% reduction by 2024."
13. CHATBOT: "That's a great step towards making your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most you can commit to right now?**"
14. USER: "This is the most I can commit to."
15. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to achieve a 50% reduction by 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Switch to reusable shopping bags.  
2. Use a refillable water bottle.  
3. Buy products with minimal packaging.  "
16. USER: "Start buying products with minimal packaging."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a great action to start with! **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or are there other actions you might consider as well?**"
18. USER: "I could also try composting."
19. CHATBOT: "Composting is an excellent complementary action to reduce waste. **Would you like to proceed with both actions, or focus on one for now?**"
20. USER: "I'll start with both actions."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great decision to start with both actions! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of buying products with minimal packaging? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my grocery list, I will choose products with minimal packaging.
2. When I enter the supermarket, I'll prioritize buying items with less packaging.
3. If I run out of pantry staples, I will restock with bulk items to reduce packaging."
22. USER: "When I enter the supermarket."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a clear and actionable cue! **Is there a specific day in the next 7 days when you plan to visit the supermarket?**"
24. USER: "Saturday."
25. CHATBOT: "Great! **Which supermarket will you be visiting on Saturday?** This will help make your cue even more specific."
26. USER: "I'll be visiting the local co-op."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your reduction goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your packaging choices."
28. USER: "Sure, that sounds great!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve a 50% reduction by 2024.

**Action:** buying products with minimal packaging

**Implementation Intention:** when I enter the supermarket on Saturday at the local co-op then buying products with minimal packaging"
30. USER: "Thank you for the support!"
31. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
