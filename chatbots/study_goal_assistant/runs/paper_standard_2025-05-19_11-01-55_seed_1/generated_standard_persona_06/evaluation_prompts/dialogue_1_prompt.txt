system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to reduce plastic waste."
3. Chatbot: "Reducing plastic waste is a fantastic and impactful goal! It's wonderful to see your commitment to making a positive environmental change. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use reusable shopping bags  
- Opt for glass containers  
- Support zero-waste stores"
4. User: "Using reusable bags and bottles."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid strategy to start with! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of reducing plastic waste?**"
6. User: "I think it’s a good start."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for reducing plastic waste?**

For Example:
1. Eliminate single-use plastic by 50% in 3 months.
2. Reduce plastic waste by 30% in 6 weeks.
3. Cut plastic consumption by 25% in 2 months."
8. User: "Reduce plastic waste by 40%."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of reducing plastic waste already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Reduce plastic waste by 40% by December 31, 2025.'"
10. User: "Reduce plastic waste by 40% by June 2024."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of reducing plastic waste sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Reducing plastic waste by 40% by December 2023.
2. Achieving a 50% reduction by June 2024.
3. Implementing 5 new strategies by June 2024."
12. User: "Achieve a 50% reduction by 2024."
13. Chatbot: "That's a great step towards making your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most you can commit to right now?**"
14. User: "This is the most I can commit to."
15. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to achieve a 50% reduction by 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Switch to reusable shopping bags.  
2. Use a refillable water bottle.  
3. Buy products with minimal packaging.  "
16. User: "Start buying products with minimal packaging."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great action to start with! **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or are there other actions you might consider as well?**"
18. User: "I could also try composting."
19. Chatbot: "Composting is an excellent complementary action to reduce waste. **Would you like to proceed with both actions, or focus on one for now?**"
20. User: "I'll start with both actions."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great decision to start with both actions! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of buying products with minimal packaging? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my grocery list, I will choose products with minimal packaging.
2. When I enter the supermarket, I'll prioritize buying items with less packaging.
3. If I run out of pantry staples, I will restock with bulk items to reduce packaging."
22. User: "When I enter the supermarket."
23. Chatbot: "That's a clear and actionable cue! **Is there a specific day in the next 7 days when you plan to visit the supermarket?**"
24. User: "Saturday."
25. Chatbot: "Great! **Which supermarket will you be visiting on Saturday?** This will help make your cue even more specific."
26. User: "I'll be visiting the local co-op."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your reduction goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your packaging choices."
28. User: "Sure, that sounds great!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve a 50% reduction by 2024.

**Action:** buying products with minimal packaging

**Implementation Intention:** when I enter the supermarket on Saturday at the local co-op then buying products with minimal packaging"
30. User: "Thank you for the support!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
