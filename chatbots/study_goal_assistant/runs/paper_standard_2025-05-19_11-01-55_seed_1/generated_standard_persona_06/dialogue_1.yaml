            is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of reducing plastic waste?",
            is somewhat redundant. The user has already indicated their strategy,
            and the chatbot should ideally help refine or expand on it rather than
            question its adequacy. This could lead to a slight dialogue breakdown
            as it doesn't advance the conversation towards setting a specific goal
            or action step. The chatbot should focus on guiding the user to formulate
            a more specific goal or action plan rather than questioning the user's

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance asks the user to specify which supermarket
            they will be visiting on Saturday. This request aims to make the user's
            plan more specific, which aligns with the chatbot's goal-setting task.
            However, the level of specificity requested may not be necessary for the
            user's goal of reducing plastic waste. The user has already provided a
            clear cue ("When I enter the supermarket") and a specific day ("Saturday").
            Asking for the specific supermarket might be seen as redundant or overly
            detailed, which could lead to a lack of brevity. However, it does not
            significantly disrupt the conversation or make it difficult for the user
