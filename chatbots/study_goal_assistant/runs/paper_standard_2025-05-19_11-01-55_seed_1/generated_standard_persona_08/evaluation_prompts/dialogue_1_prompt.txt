system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to engage with students through mentorship."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Mentoring students can be incredibly rewarding and impactful for both you and the students.

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to engage with the students through mentorship?**

For example:  
- Regularly schedule mentorship sessions  
- Develop personalized mentorship plans  
- Utilize feedback for improvement"
4. User: "I haven't planned specifics yet."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your mentorship goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research effective mentorship techniques and strategies to better support and engage with students.
   
2. Learn about the specific needs and challenges faced by the students you are mentoring to tailor your approach accordingly.

3. Develop communication and active listening skills to foster a supportive and open environment for student mentorship."
6. User: "I want to research effective mentorship techniques."
7. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching effective mentorship techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five mentorship strategies by June 2 for student engagement."
8. User: "Identify three strategies by April 15."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three mentorship strategies by April 15 sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies by today.  
2. Identifying three strategies by tomorrow.  
3. Identifying five strategies by April 15."
10. User: "Identifying five strategies by April 15."
11. Chatbot: "Great! Identifying five mentorship strategies by April 15 is a more challenging goal. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
12. User: "This is the right level."
13. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal of identifying five strategies by April 15. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on effective mentorship strategies.  
2. Attend a webinar on student mentorship techniques.  
3. Interview experienced mentors for their best practices.  "
14. User: "I'll read a mentorship book."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think this action will help you identify the strategies you need, or is there another action you might consider?**"
16. User: "Yes, I believe it will."
17. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading a mentorship book? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read a mentorship book for 20 minutes.
2. When I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll read a chapter of a mentorship book.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will spend 30 minutes reading a mentorship book."
18. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Do you have a specific location where you usually finish your morning coffee, and would you like to read your mentorship book there?**"
20. User: "Yes, I usually sit in my kitchen."
21. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days within the next 7 days?**"
22. User: "I'll start tomorrow and continue daily."
23. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
24. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
25. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identifying five strategies by April 15.

**Action:** read a mentorship book

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, then I will read a mentorship book"
26. User: "Thank you for your help!"
27. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
