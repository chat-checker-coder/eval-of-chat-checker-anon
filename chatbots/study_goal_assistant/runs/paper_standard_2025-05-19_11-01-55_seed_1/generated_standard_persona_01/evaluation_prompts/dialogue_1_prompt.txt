# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm aiming to land my first full-time job!"
3. Chatbot: "That's an exciting goal! Landing your first full-time job is a significant milestone and can open up many new opportunities for you. 

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong professional network  
- Tailored resume and cover letter  
- Interview preparation skills"
4. User: "I've started networking and revising my resume."
5. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Networking and having a strong resume are crucial steps in the job search process. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "I think it's a good start, but I'd love more guidance on interview skills!"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify the key skills and qualifications required for entry-level positions in your desired field.
2. Develop a strong resume and cover letter by learning how to effectively highlight your skills and experiences.
3. Practice common interview questions and techniques to improve your confidence and performance during job interviews."
8. User: "I want to practice interview questions!"
9. Chatbot: "Practicing interview questions is a great step towards landing your first full-time job. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "I want to master interview techniques."
11. Chatbot: "That's a great learning goal! Mastering interview techniques will definitely help you in your job search.

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal?**"
12. User: "Yes, let's set it as my goal!"
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering interview techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Learn 5 interview techniques by June 2, 2025."
14. User: "Learn 5 interview techniques by December 31, 2024."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning interview techniques sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Learning 5 interview techniques by June 30, 2025.
2. Mastering 10 interview techniques by December 31, 2024.
3. Practicing 5 techniques in real interviews by December 31, 2024."
16. User: "Master 8 interview techniques by Dec 31, 2024."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "I think this is just right!"
19. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to master 8 interview techniques by the end of 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend 5 interview skills workshops.  
2. Read 3 books on interview strategies.  
3. Practice mock interviews with a career coach.  "
20. User: "Attend an interview workshop next week."
21. Chatbot: "Attending an interview workshop next week is a great step towards mastering interview techniques. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or would you like to consider additional actions to complement it?**"
22. User: "I might practice with friends too!"
23. Chatbot: "Attending an interview workshop next week is a fantastic way to enhance your skills. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending the workshop? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will review my interview workshop notes.
2. When I log off work on Friday, I'll schedule time for the interview workshop.
3. If I see my calendar reminder for next week, I'll register for the workshop."
24. User: "When I check my planner tonight, I'll register for the workshop."
25. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! Checking your planner is a reliable and noticeable event. **Is there a specific location where you usually check your planner?**"
26. User: "At my desk every evening."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering techniques. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on attending the workshop."
28. User: "Sure, I'd appreciate that!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master 8 interview techniques by Dec 31, 2024.

**Action:** Attend an interview workshop next week.
