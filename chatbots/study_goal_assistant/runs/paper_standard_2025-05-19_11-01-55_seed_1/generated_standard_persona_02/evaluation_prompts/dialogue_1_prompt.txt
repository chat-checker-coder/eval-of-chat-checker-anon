# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want a fitness goal."
3. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! Setting a fitness goal can be incredibly rewarding and beneficial for your overall health and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced nutrition plan  
- Personal fitness coach"
4. User: "No current strategy in place."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your fitness goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of fitness routines to find one that aligns with your goals and interests.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness and overall health.
3. Study the correct form and techniques for various exercises to prevent injury and maximize effectiveness."
6. User: "Learn about proper nutrition."
7. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about proper nutrition already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three nutrition plans by Friday and choose one."
8. User: "Identify three nutrition plans weekly."
9. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to start identifying these nutrition plans weekly?**"
10. User: "I'll start on Monday."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three nutrition plans weekly starting on Monday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Identifying three nutrition plans today.
2. Identifying five plans by Wednesday.
3. Identifying six plans weekly starting today."
12. User: "I'll identify five plans weekly."
13. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, like incorporating a specific dietary focus or trying new recipes each week?**"
14. User: "Sure, I'll try new recipes."
15. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! **Could you make it even more challenging by trying a new recipe every day, or is this the most you can commit to right now?**"
16. User: "I'll try a new recipe daily."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great goal to set for yourself! Now that I know you want to identify nutrition plans and try new recipes, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 nutrition books weekly.  
2. Watch 5 cooking tutorials on YouTube.  
3. Consult a nutritionist for personalized advice.  "
18. User: "Watch 5 cooking tutorials weekly."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical and enjoyable way to learn new recipes and nutrition strategies! **Do you want to proceed with this action to help achieve your goal?**"
20. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with that."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great decision! Watching cooking tutorials can be both fun and educational. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching 5 cooking tutorials weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch a cooking tutorial.
2. When I sit down for dinner, I'll watch a cooking tutorial on my tablet.
3. If I finish my morning coffee, I will watch a cooking tutorial."
22. User: "I'll watch one after dinner."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **On which days do you usually have dinner at home, and where do you plan to watch the tutorials?** This will help ensure your cue is concrete and reliable."
24. User: "I usually have dinner at home Monday to Friday, and I'll watch tutorials on my tablet."
25. Chatbot: "Great! Watching tutorials on your tablet after dinner from Monday to Friday sounds like a reliable plan. **Is there a specific location in your home where you usually have dinner and can watch the tutorials?** This will help make your cue even more concrete."
26. User: "I usually have dinner in the kitchen."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards trying new recipes. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your tutorials."
28. User: "Checking in sounds helpful, thanks!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify five nutrition plans weekly starting on Monday and try a new recipe daily.

**Action:** Watch 5 cooking tutorials weekly.

**Implementation Intention:** when I have dinner in the kitchen Monday to Friday, then watch 5 cooking tutorials weekly."
30. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
