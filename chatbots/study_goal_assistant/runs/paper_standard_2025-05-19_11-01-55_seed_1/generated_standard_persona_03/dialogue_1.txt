Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to improve my work-life balance."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving your work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can lead to greater happiness and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Set clear work boundaries  
- Schedule regular personal time  
- Prioritize tasks effectively"
4. USER: "I set clear work boundaries."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid strategy. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but I need help."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for improving your work-life balance?**

For Example:
1. Limit work emails to 30 minutes daily.
2. Take two 15-minute breaks during work hours.
3. Leave work by 5 PM every day."
8. USER: "I'd like to take two breaks."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of taking two 15-minute breaks during work hours already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Take 15-minute breaks at 11:30 AM and 3:00 PM.'"
10. USER: "Take breaks at 11 AM and 3 PM."
11. CHATBOT: "**When exactly do you want to start implementing this goal?**"
12. USER: "I'll start this Monday."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of taking 15-minute breaks sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Starting your breaks today at 11 AM and 3 PM.  
2. Taking 20-minute breaks instead of 15 minutes.  
3. Adding a 5-minute mindfulness exercise during each break."
14. USER: "I'll add mindfulness exercises!"
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great addition! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This feels like the right level!"
17. CHATBOT: "It's wonderful that you've set a goal to incorporate breaks and mindfulness into your routine. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Set phone reminders for break times.  
2. Download a mindfulness app.  
3. Find a quiet spot for breaks.  "
18. USER: "I'll download a mindfulness app."
19. CHATBOT: "Downloading a mindfulness app is a great step towards achieving your goal. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. USER: "I'll set phone reminders too."
21. CHATBOT: "Downloading a mindfulness app is a great step towards enhancing your well-being. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will download a mindfulness app.
2. When I close my laptop for a break, I'll download a mindfulness app.
3. If I see the clock strike 11 AM, I will download a mindfulness app."
22. USER: "When I close my laptop."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific day and location where you usually close your laptop that you can associate with downloading the mindfulness app?**"
24. USER: "In my home office, daily."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I close my laptop in my home office daily, I'll download a mindfulness app"?**"
26. USER: "Yes, let's proceed with that."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards taking mindful breaks. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on downloading the app."
28. USER: "Yes, that sounds good. Thanks!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Take 15-minute breaks at 11 AM and 3 PM starting this Monday, with a 5-minute mindfulness exercise during each break.

**Action:** Download a mindfulness app.

**Implementation Intention:** When I close my laptop in my home office daily, I'll download a mindfulness app."
30. USER: "Thanks for the summary!"
31. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
