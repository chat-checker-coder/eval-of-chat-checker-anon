system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to improve my work-life balance."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can lead to greater happiness and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Set clear work boundaries  
- Schedule regular personal time  
- Prioritize tasks effectively"
4. User: "I set clear work boundaries."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid strategy. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but I need help."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for improving your work-life balance?**

For Example:
1. Limit work emails to 30 minutes daily.
2. Take two 15-minute breaks during work hours.
3. Leave work by 5 PM every day."
8. User: "I'd like to take two breaks."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of taking two 15-minute breaks during work hours already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Take 15-minute breaks at 11:30 AM and 3:00 PM.'"
10. User: "Take breaks at 11 AM and 3 PM."
11. Chatbot: "**When exactly do you want to start implementing this goal?**"
12. User: "I'll start this Monday."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of taking 15-minute breaks sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Starting your breaks today at 11 AM and 3 PM.  
2. Taking 20-minute breaks instead of 15 minutes.  
3. Adding a 5-minute mindfulness exercise during each break."
14. User: "I'll add mindfulness exercises!"
15. Chatbot: "That's a great addition! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This feels like the right level!"
17. Chatbot: "It's wonderful that you've set a goal to incorporate breaks and mindfulness into your routine. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Set phone reminders for break times.  
2. Download a mindfulness app.  
3. Find a quiet spot for breaks.  "
18. User: "I'll download a mindfulness app."
19. Chatbot: "Downloading a mindfulness app is a great step towards achieving your goal. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "I'll set phone reminders too."
21. Chatbot: "Downloading a mindfulness app is a great step towards enhancing your well-being. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will download a mindfulness app.
2. When I close my laptop for a break, I'll download a mindfulness app.
3. If I see the clock strike 11 AM, I will download a mindfulness app."
22. User: "When I close my laptop."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific day and location where you usually close your laptop that you can associate with downloading the mindfulness app?**"
24. User: "In my home office, daily."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I close my laptop in my home office daily, I'll download a mindfulness app"?**"
26. User: "Yes, let's proceed with that."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards taking mindful breaks. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on downloading the app."
28. User: "Yes, that sounds good. Thanks!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Take 15-minute breaks at 11 AM and 3 PM starting this Monday, with a 5-minute mindfulness exercise during each break.

**Action:** Download a mindfulness app.

**Implementation Intention:** When I close my laptop in my home office daily, I'll download a mindfulness app."
30. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
