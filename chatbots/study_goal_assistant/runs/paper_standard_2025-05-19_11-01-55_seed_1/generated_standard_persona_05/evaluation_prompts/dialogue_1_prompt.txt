system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to express myself through art."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Art is such a powerful medium for self-expression and creativity. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular art practice sessions  
- Diverse art material exploration  
- Attend art workshops regularly"
4. User: "Attend workshops sounds exciting!"
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to learn and grow in your artistic journey. **Do you think attending workshops is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of expressing yourself through art?**"
6. User: "Yes, I think it is!"
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for expressing yourself through art?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 new paintings by December.
2. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery.
3. Create a 10-piece art portfolio."
8. User: "I want to exhibit my art."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of exhibiting your art already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Exhibit my art in a local gallery by July 15th.'"
10. User: "Exhibit my art in a local gallery by June!"
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Number of artworks displayed."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **How many artworks do you want to display in the gallery by June?**"
14. User: "I want to display 10 pieces!"
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of exhibiting 10 pieces of art in a local gallery by June sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Exhibiting 10 pieces by May 31st.
2. Exhibiting 15 pieces by June.
3. Exhibiting 10 pieces in two different galleries."
16. User: "Exhibiting 15 pieces by June!"
17. Chatbot: "That's a great way to push yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "This feels just right for me!"
19. Chatbot: "Exhibiting your art in a local gallery by June is an exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Create five new art pieces by April.  
2. Contact local galleries for exhibition opportunities.  
3. Attend art networking events to meet gallery owners."
20. User: "Contact local galleries for opportunities!"
21. Chatbot: "Reaching out to local galleries is a great step towards your goal! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of contacting them? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will contact a local gallery.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll email a gallery about my art.
3. If I see my art supplies in the morning, I'll call a gallery for opportunities."
22. User: "When I close my laptop after work, I'll email a gallery!"
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you usually close your laptop after work, and where will you be when this happens?**"
24. User: "Tuesday, at home in my studio."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exhibiting your art. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your gallery contacts."
26. User: "Sure, I'd love that!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Exhibit 15 pieces of my art in a local gallery by June.

**Action:** Contact local galleries for opportunities

**Implementation Intention:** when I close my laptop after work on Tuesday in my studio, I'll email a gallery about my art"
28. User: "Thanks so much for the help!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
