Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to express myself through art."
3. CHATBOT: "That's wonderful! Art is such a powerful medium for self-expression and creativity. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular art practice sessions  
- Diverse art material exploration  
- Attend art workshops regularly"
4. USER: "Attend workshops sounds exciting!"
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to learn and grow in your artistic journey. **Do you think attending workshops is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of expressing yourself through art?**"
6. USER: "Yes, I think it is!"
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for expressing yourself through art?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 new paintings by December.
2. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery.
3. Create a 10-piece art portfolio."
8. USER: "I want to exhibit my art."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exhibiting your art already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Exhibit my art in a local gallery by July 15th.'"
10. USER: "Exhibit my art in a local gallery by June!"
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "Number of artworks displayed."
13. CHATBOT: "Great! **How many artworks do you want to display in the gallery by June?**"
14. USER: "I want to display 10 pieces!"
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exhibiting 10 pieces of art in a local gallery by June sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Exhibiting 10 pieces by May 31st.
2. Exhibiting 15 pieces by June.
3. Exhibiting 10 pieces in two different galleries."
16. USER: "Exhibiting 15 pieces by June!"
17. CHATBOT: "That's a great way to push yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. USER: "This feels just right for me!"
19. CHATBOT: "Exhibiting your art in a local gallery by June is an exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Create five new art pieces by April.  
2. Contact local galleries for exhibition opportunities.  
3. Attend art networking events to meet gallery owners."
20. USER: "Contact local galleries for opportunities!"
21. CHATBOT: "Reaching out to local galleries is a great step towards your goal! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of contacting them? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will contact a local gallery.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll email a gallery about my art.
3. If I see my art supplies in the morning, I'll call a gallery for opportunities."
22. USER: "When I close my laptop after work, I'll email a gallery!"
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you usually close your laptop after work, and where will you be when this happens?**"
24. USER: "Tuesday, at home in my studio."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exhibiting your art. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your gallery contacts."
26. USER: "Sure, I'd love that!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Exhibit 15 pieces of my art in a local gallery by June.

**Action:** Contact local galleries for opportunities

**Implementation Intention:** when I close my laptop after work on Tuesday in my studio, I'll email a gallery about my art"
28. USER: "Thanks so much for the help!"
