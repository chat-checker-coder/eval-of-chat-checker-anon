system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to express myself through art."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Art is such a powerful medium for self-expression and creativity. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular art practice sessions  
- Diverse art material exploration  
- Attend art workshops regularly"
4. User: "Attend workshops sounds exciting!"
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to learn and grow in your artistic journey. **Do you think attending workshops is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of expressing yourself through art?**"
6. User: "Yes, I think it is!"
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for expressing yourself through art?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 new paintings by December.
2. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery.
3. Create a 10-piece art portfolio."
8. User: "I want to exhibit my art."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of exhibiting your art already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Exhibit my art in a local gallery by July 15th.'"
10. User: "Exhibit my art in a local gallery by June!"
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Number of artworks displayed."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **How many artworks do you want to display in the gallery by June?**"
14. User: "I want to display 10 pieces!"
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of exhibiting 10 pieces of art in a local gallery by June sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Exhibiting 10 pieces by May 31st.
2. Exhibiting 15 pieces by June.
3. Exhibiting 10 pieces in two different galleries."
16. User: "Exhibiting 15 pieces by June!"
17. Chatbot: "That's a great way to push yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "This feels just right for me!"
19. Chatbot: "Exhibiting your art in a local gallery by June is an exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Create five new art pieces by April.  
2. Contact local galleries for exhibition opportunities.  
3. Attend art networking events to meet gallery owners."
20. User: "Contact local galleries for opportunities!"

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
21. Chatbot: "Reaching out to local galleries is a great step towards your goal! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of contacting them? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will contact a local gallery.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll email a gallery about my art.
3. If I see my art supplies in the morning, I'll call a gallery for opportunities."
