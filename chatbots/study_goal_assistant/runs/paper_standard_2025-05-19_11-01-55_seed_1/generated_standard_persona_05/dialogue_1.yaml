    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: 'The chatbot''s latest utterance suggests that the user''s goal
            lacks a concrete outcome, which is not entirely accurate. The user has
            already specified a clear and measurable goal: ''Exhibit my art in a local
            gallery by June.'' This goal includes a specific action (exhibiting art)
            and a deadline (by June), which are key components of a well-defined goal.
            The chatbot''s request for a measurable outcome seems redundant and unnecessary,
            as the user''s goal already contains measurable elements. This can lead
            to confusion for the user, as they might feel their goal is not understood
            or acknowledged properly by the chatbot. Therefore, this response can
            be classified as a breakdown due to ''Redundancy'' and ''Ignore expectation''.'

            gallery by June and mentioned measuring the outcome by the number of artworks
            displayed. The chatbot appropriately follows up by asking for a specific
            number of artworks, which is necessary to make the goal more concrete
            and measurable. This aligns with the task of guiding the user in formulating
            a specific and challenging goal. There is no indication of a breakdown
