Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to improve social skills."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving social skills is a wonderful goal that can enhance your personal and professional life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to improve your social skills?**

For example:  
- Attend social events regularly  
- Practice active listening skills  
- Join a public speaking group"
4. USER: "I don't have a plan yet."
5. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improved social skills. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and practice active listening techniques to enhance your ability to engage in meaningful conversations.
2. Learn about different body language cues and how they can impact social interactions.
3. Study and apply strategies for initiating and maintaining conversations in various social settings."
6. USER: "I'll start with active listening."
7. CHATBOT: "Your goal of researching and practicing active listening techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research and practice three active listening techniques by Friday."
8. USER: "I'll practice two techniques weekly."
9. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! **When exactly do you want to start practicing these techniques?**"
10. USER: "I'll start this Monday."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of practicing active listening techniques sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Practicing three techniques starting today.  
2. Practicing daily instead of weekly.  
3. Identifying four techniques before practicing."
12. USER: "I'll identify four techniques first."
13. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by practicing these techniques daily instead of weekly?**"
14. USER: "Practicing daily sounds good."
15. CHATBOT: "Great! Practicing daily will definitely make your goal more challenging and rewarding. **Is there anything else you think could make this goal even more challenging, or are you happy with it now?**"
16. USER: "I'm happy with it now."
17. CHATBOT: "It's wonderful that you're committed to practicing active listening techniques daily. **Now that I know you want to enhance your listening skills, what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube videos on active listening techniques.  
2. Read a book on effective communication skills.  
3. Attend a workshop on active listening strategies.  "
18. USER: "I'll watch 3 YouTube videos."
19. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! Watching YouTube videos on active listening techniques can be very insightful. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will watch 3 YouTube videos on active listening.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll watch 3 YouTube videos on active listening.
3. If I sit down for lunch, I will watch 3 YouTube videos on active listening."
20. USER: "When I close my laptop."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid cue! **Could you specify a concrete day or days when you plan to close your laptop and watch the videos?** This will help ensure you have a clear plan in place."
22. USER: "Every weekday after work."
23. CHATBOT: "Great! Watching the videos every weekday after work when you close your laptop is a consistent and reliable cue. **Could you also specify a physical location where you'll be watching these videos?** This will help solidify your plan."
24. USER: "In my home office."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards active listening. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Practice four active listening techniques daily starting this Monday.

**Action:** Watch 3 YouTube videos on active listening techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** when I close my laptop every weekday after work in my home office then watch 3 YouTube videos on active listening techniques."
28. USER: "Thanks for your help!"
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
