Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Enhancing my college application profile."
3. Chatbot: "Enhancing your college application profile is a fantastic goal! It can open up many opportunities for your future and help you stand out to admissions committees. 

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to enhance your application profile?**

For example:  
- Strong volunteer experience  
- Leadership roles in clubs  
- High academic achievements"
4. User: "I have some ideas but not a solid plan yet."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve enhancing your college application profile. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify extracurricular activities or volunteer opportunities that align with your interests and can strengthen your college application profile.

2. Learn about the specific requirements and expectations of the colleges you are interested in to tailor your application accordingly.

3. Develop and improve your personal statement writing skills by studying successful examples and practicing writing compelling narratives about your experiences and goals."
6. User: "I'd like to improve my personal statement writing skills."
7. Chatbot: "Your goal of improving personal statement writing skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Analyze 5 personal statements by Friday, draft 2 narratives.'"
8. User: "Analyze 3 by next week."
9. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **What specific day next week do you want to complete the analysis by?**"
10. User: "Let's aim for Thursday."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of analyzing personal statements sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Analyzing 3 personal statements by today.
2. Analyzing 5 personal statements by next Thursday.
3. Analyzing 3 personal statements by this Wednesday."
12. User: "I'll go for option 2."
13. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
14. User: "This is my limit for now."
15. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to analyze 5 personal statements by next Thursday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 5 successful personal statements online.  
2. Attend a college application workshop.  
3. Discuss with a college admissions counselor.  "
16. User: "I'll read 5 statements online."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to gain insights into effective personal statements. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be better suited?**"
18. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step towards crafting a strong personal statement. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading 5 successful personal statements online? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read a successful personal statement online.
2. When I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll read a personal statement.
3. If I close my laptop for the day, I will read a personal statement online."
20. User: "When I finish breakfast, I'll start."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that will help you remember to start reading the personal statements?**"
22. User: "I usually have breakfast at home."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having breakfast at home is a consistent and reliable cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish breakfast at home, I'll read 5 successful personal statements online"?**"
24. User: "Yes, that's perfect."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards analyzing statements. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
26. User: "That would be great, thank you!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Analyze 5 personal statements by next Thursday.

**Action:** Read 5 successful personal statements online.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish breakfast at home, I'll read 5 successful personal statements online."
28. User: "Thanks for all the help!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
