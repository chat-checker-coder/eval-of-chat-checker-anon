            of the goal and action we set together:


            **Goal:** Identify five nutrition plans weekly starting on Monday and
            try a new recipe daily.


            **Action:** Watch 5 cooking tutorials weekly.


            **Implementation Intention:** when I have dinner in the kitchen Monday
            to Friday, then watch 5 cooking tutorials weekly.'
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance provides a summary of the user's
                goal, action, and implementation intention. However, there is a semantic
                error in the implementation intention. The intention states "when
                I have dinner in the kitchen Monday to Friday, then watch 5 cooking
                tutorials weekly," which is not specific enough and does not align
                with the user's plan to watch one tutorial after dinner each day.
                The intention should specify watching one tutorial after dinner each
                day, rather than weekly, to match the user's plan. This discrepancy
                can cause confusion and disrupt the flow of the conversation, as it
                does not accurately reflect the user's intended plan. Therefore, this
                is a breakdown due to a semantic error.

            **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still
            being achievable for you?** If you can''t, this is also okay.


            You for example could make your goal challenging by:

            1. Attending 3 workshops by June 30th, 2025.

            2. Attending 5 workshops by March 31st, 2025.

            3. Attending 3 workshops by February 28th, 2025.'
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest response is aimed at encouraging the user
                to make their goal more challenging while still being achievable.
                However, the examples provided by the chatbot are not well-aligned
                with the user's current goal. The user has already set a specific
                goal of attending 3 workshops by March 31st, 2025, which is more specific
                than the chatbot's first example. The second example suggests attending
                5 workshops by the same date, which is indeed more challenging, but
                the first example is less challenging than the user's current goal.
                This could lead to confusion for the user. Additionally, the chatbot's
                suggestion to make the goal more challenging might not align with
                the user's intention to relax and express themselves, which could
                be seen as a contradiction to the user's initial goal of relaxation.
                Therefore, the response could be seen as a breakdown due to a contradiction
                and lack of clarity in the examples provided.

            you measure the outcome of your goal?**
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: 'The chatbot''s latest utterance suggests that the user''s
                goal lacks a concrete outcome, which is not entirely accurate. The
                user has already specified a clear and measurable goal: ''Exhibit
                my art in a local gallery by June.'' This goal includes a specific
                action (exhibiting art) and a deadline (by June), which are key components
                of a well-defined goal. The chatbot''s request for a measurable outcome
                seems redundant and unnecessary, as the user''s goal already contains
                measurable elements. This can lead to confusion for the user, as they
                might feel their goal is not understood or acknowledged properly by
                the chatbot. Therefore, this response can be classified as a breakdown
                due to ''Redundancy'' and ''Ignore expectation''.'

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot acknowledges the user's current strategy of using
                reusable bags and bottles, which is relevant to the user's goal of
                reducing plastic waste. However, the chatbot's follow-up question,
                "Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve
                your goal of reducing plastic waste?", is somewhat redundant. The
                user has already indicated their strategy, and the chatbot should
                ideally help refine or expand on it rather than question its adequacy.
                This could lead to a slight dialogue breakdown as it doesn't advance
                the conversation towards setting a specific goal or action step. The
                chatbot should focus on guiding the user to formulate a more specific
                goal or action plan rather than questioning the user's existing strategy.

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance acknowledges the user's strategy
                of meal prepping and provides a positive reinforcement by stating
                it's a great strategy. However, the follow-up question "Do you think
                this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?" is
                somewhat redundant because the user has already indicated their plan
                to meal prep, implying they believe it is a good strategy. The chatbot
                could have instead asked for more details about the user's meal prepping
                plan or suggested ways to enhance it. Despite this, the conversation
                can still continue smoothly as the user can respond to the question.
                Therefore, the breakdown is minor, and the conversation can proceed
                without significant disruption.
