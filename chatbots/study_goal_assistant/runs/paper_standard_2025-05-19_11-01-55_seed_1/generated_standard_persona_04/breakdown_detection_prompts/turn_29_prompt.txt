system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Hi there! I want to explore painting as a hobby."
3. Chatbot: "Exploring painting as a hobby sounds like a wonderful and creative goal! **Would you like to set this as your primary goal, or is there a broader objective you have in mind, like improving your artistic skills, finding a relaxing pastime, or expressing your emotions through art?**"
4. User: "I'd love to relax and express myself!"
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a beautiful goal! Relaxing and expressing yourself through painting can be incredibly fulfilling and therapeutic. **Do you already have a strategy or approach in mind for how you plan to relax and express yourself through your art?**

For example:  
- Regular painting schedule  
- Dedicated creative space  
- Art classes or workshops"
6. User: "I like the idea of workshops."
7. Chatbot: "Workshops can be a great way to learn new techniques and get inspired by others. **Do you think attending workshops is a good strategy to achieve your goal of relaxing and expressing yourself through painting?**"
8. User: "Yes, I think that's perfect!"
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your painting journey?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 paintings in one month.
2. Attend 3 painting workshops this quarter.
3. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery by year-end."
10. User: "I'll attend 3 workshops this quarter."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of attending painting workshops already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete 3 painting workshops by June 30th, 2025.'"
12. User: "Attend 3 painting workshops by March 31st, 2025."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of attending painting workshops sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Attending 3 workshops by June 30th, 2025.
2. Attending 5 workshops by March 31st, 2025.
3. Attending 3 workshops by February 28th, 2025."
14. User: "Let's aim for 3 by February!"
15. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal to attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research local painting workshops online.  
2. Register for workshops in advance.  
3. Set reminders for workshop dates.  "
16. User: "I'll start by researching workshops."
17. Chatbot: "Great start! Researching workshops will give you a clear idea of what's available and help you plan accordingly. **Do you think this is the best action to begin with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
18. User: "Researching is the best start!"
19. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Researching painting workshops will definitely set you on the right path. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research painting workshops for 15 minutes.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll spend 10 minutes researching painting workshops.
3. If I sit down for lunch, I will dedicate 5 minutes to finding painting workshops."
20. User: "I'll research workshops after my coffee."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a reliable cue for this action?**"
22. User: "I usually have my coffee in the kitchen."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having your coffee in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this cue: "When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"?**"
24. User: "Yes, let's proceed with that!"
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards attending workshops. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025.

**Action:** Researching painting workshops

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"
28. User: "Thank you! I'm excited to start."
