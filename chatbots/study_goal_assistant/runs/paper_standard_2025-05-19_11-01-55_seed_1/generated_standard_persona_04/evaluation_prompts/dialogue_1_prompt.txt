system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Hi there! I want to explore painting as a hobby."
3. Chatbot: "Exploring painting as a hobby sounds like a wonderful and creative goal! **Would you like to set this as your primary goal, or is there a broader objective you have in mind, like improving your artistic skills, finding a relaxing pastime, or expressing your emotions through art?**"
4. User: "I'd love to relax and express myself!"
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a beautiful goal! Relaxing and expressing yourself through painting can be incredibly fulfilling and therapeutic. **Do you already have a strategy or approach in mind for how you plan to relax and express yourself through your art?**

For example:  
- Regular painting schedule  
- Dedicated creative space  
- Art classes or workshops"
6. User: "I like the idea of workshops."
7. Chatbot: "Workshops can be a great way to learn new techniques and get inspired by others. **Do you think attending workshops is a good strategy to achieve your goal of relaxing and expressing yourself through painting?**"
8. User: "Yes, I think that's perfect!"
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your painting journey?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 paintings in one month.
2. Attend 3 painting workshops this quarter.
3. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery by year-end."
10. User: "I'll attend 3 workshops this quarter."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of attending painting workshops already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete 3 painting workshops by June 30th, 2025.'"
12. User: "Attend 3 painting workshops by March 31st, 2025."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of attending painting workshops sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Attending 3 workshops by June 30th, 2025.
2. Attending 5 workshops by March 31st, 2025.
3. Attending 3 workshops by February 28th, 2025."
14. User: "Let's aim for 3 by February!"
15. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal to attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research local painting workshops online.  
2. Register for workshops in advance.  
3. Set reminders for workshop dates.  "
16. User: "I'll start by researching workshops."
17. Chatbot: "Great start! Researching workshops will give you a clear idea of what's available and help you plan accordingly. **Do you think this is the best action to begin with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
18. User: "Researching is the best start!"
19. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Researching painting workshops will definitely set you on the right path. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research painting workshops for 15 minutes.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll spend 10 minutes researching painting workshops.
3. If I sit down for lunch, I will dedicate 5 minutes to finding painting workshops."
20. User: "I'll research workshops after my coffee."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a reliable cue for this action?**"
22. User: "I usually have my coffee in the kitchen."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having your coffee in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this cue: "When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"?**"
24. User: "Yes, let's proceed with that!"
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards attending workshops. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025.

**Action:** Researching painting workshops

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"
28. User: "Thank you! I'm excited to start."
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
