            workshops by March 31st, 2025, which is more specific than the chatbot's
            first example. The second example suggests attending 5 workshops by the
            same date, which is indeed more challenging, but the first example is
            less challenging than the user's current goal. This could lead to confusion
            for the user. Additionally, the chatbot's suggestion to make the goal
