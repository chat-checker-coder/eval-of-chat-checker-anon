Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Hi there! I want to explore painting as a hobby."
3. CHATBOT: "Exploring painting as a hobby sounds like a wonderful and creative goal! **Would you like to set this as your primary goal, or is there a broader objective you have in mind, like improving your artistic skills, finding a relaxing pastime, or expressing your emotions through art?**"
4. USER: "I'd love to relax and express myself!"
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a beautiful goal! Relaxing and expressing yourself through painting can be incredibly fulfilling and therapeutic. **Do you already have a strategy or approach in mind for how you plan to relax and express yourself through your art?**

For example:  
- Regular painting schedule  
- Dedicated creative space  
- Art classes or workshops"
6. USER: "I like the idea of workshops."
7. CHATBOT: "Workshops can be a great way to learn new techniques and get inspired by others. **Do you think attending workshops is a good strategy to achieve your goal of relaxing and expressing yourself through painting?**"
8. USER: "Yes, I think that's perfect!"
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your painting journey?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 paintings in one month.
2. Attend 3 painting workshops this quarter.
3. Exhibit artwork in a local gallery by year-end."
10. USER: "I'll attend 3 workshops this quarter."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of attending painting workshops already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete 3 painting workshops by June 30th, 2025.'"
12. USER: "Attend 3 painting workshops by March 31st, 2025."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of attending painting workshops sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Attending 3 workshops by June 30th, 2025.
2. Attending 5 workshops by March 31st, 2025.
3. Attending 3 workshops by February 28th, 2025."
14. USER: "Let's aim for 3 by February!"
15. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic goal to attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research local painting workshops online.  
2. Register for workshops in advance.  
3. Set reminders for workshop dates.  "
16. USER: "I'll start by researching workshops."
17. CHATBOT: "Great start! Researching workshops will give you a clear idea of what's available and help you plan accordingly. **Do you think this is the best action to begin with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
18. USER: "Researching is the best start!"
19. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! Researching painting workshops will definitely set you on the right path. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research painting workshops for 15 minutes.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll spend 10 minutes researching painting workshops.
3. If I sit down for lunch, I will dedicate 5 minutes to finding painting workshops."
20. USER: "I'll research workshops after my coffee."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a reliable cue for this action?**"
22. USER: "I usually have my coffee in the kitchen."
23. CHATBOT: "Great! Having your coffee in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this cue: "When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"?**"
24. USER: "Yes, let's proceed with that!"
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards attending workshops. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Attend 3 painting workshops by February 28th, 2025.

**Action:** Researching painting workshops

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen, I will research painting workshops"
28. USER: "Thank you! I'm excited to start."
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
