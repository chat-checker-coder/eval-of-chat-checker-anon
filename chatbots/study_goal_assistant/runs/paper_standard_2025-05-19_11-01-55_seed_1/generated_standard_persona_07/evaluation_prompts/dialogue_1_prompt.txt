# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to eat healthier."
3. Chatbot: "Eating healthier sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your overall health, losing weight, or increasing your energy levels. **Would you still like to keep eating healthier as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Let's focus on losing weight."
5. Chatbot: "Losing weight is a fantastic goal that can lead to numerous health benefits and boost your confidence. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Meal prepping weekly  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Tracking calorie intake"
6. User: "I plan to meal prep."
7. Chatbot: "Meal prepping is a great strategy to help control portions and ensure you're eating healthy meals. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Yes, it's manageable for me."
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that meal prep is manageable for you! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for your weight loss journey?**

For Example:
1. Lose 10 pounds in 8 weeks.
2. Drop 2 dress sizes by summer.
3. Reduce body fat by 5% in 3 months."
10. User: "Lose 10 pounds in 8 weeks."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of losing 10 pounds in 8 weeks already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Lose 10 pounds by July 14th, 2025.'"
12. User: "Lose 10 pounds by Dec 31st."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of losing 10 pounds by Dec 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Losing 10 pounds by November 30th.  
2. Losing 15 pounds by December 31st.  
3. Losing 10 pounds by December 15th."
14. User: "I’ll stick with December 31st."
15. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to add any other elements to your goal, like incorporating a specific exercise routine or dietary changes, to make it more challenging?**"
16. User: "Include a 30-minute daily walk."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great addition to your goal! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, perhaps by increasing the duration or intensity of the walk, or adding another type of exercise?**"
18. User: "Could add strength training twice weekly."
19. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic way to enhance your goal! **Do you feel this is the most challenging yet attainable version of your goal, or is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust?**"
20. User: "This feels challenging yet achievable."
21. Chatbot: "It's great to hear that you've set a challenging yet achievable goal to lose 10 pounds by Dec 31st with daily walks and strength training. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Track daily calorie intake using a food diary.  
2. Prepare healthy meals with lean proteins and vegetables.  
3. Attend a weekly yoga class for flexibility and balance."
22. User: "Prepare healthy meals this weekend."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to support your goal! **Do you want to continue with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
24. User: "I'm sticking with meal prep."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fantastic plan to stay healthy! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of preparing healthy meals this weekend? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Saturday morning workout, I will prepare healthy meals for the week.
2. When I complete my Sunday grocery shopping, I'll set aside time to meal prep.
3. If I finish my Friday evening dinner, I will plan and prep meals for the weekend."
26. User: "When I finish Sunday grocery shopping."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually do your grocery shopping on Sundays?** This will help make the cue even more concrete."
28. User: "Yes, at the local supermarket."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards losing weight. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your meal prep."
30. User: "Yes, that sounds great."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Lose 10 pounds by Dec 31st with a 30-minute daily walk and strength training twice weekly.

**Action:** Prepare healthy meals this weekend

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish Sunday grocery shopping at the local supermarket then prepare healthy meals this weekend"
32. User: "Thank you! I'll start now."
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
