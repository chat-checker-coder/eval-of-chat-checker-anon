        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance acknowledges the user's strategy

            because the user has already indicated their plan to meal prep, implying
            they believe it is a good strategy. The chatbot could have instead asked
            for more details about the user's meal prepping plan or suggested ways
            to enhance it. Despite this, the conversation can still continue smoothly
            as the user can respond to the question. Therefore, the breakdown is minor,

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed excellently in guiding the user
            through the goal-setting process. It was effective, appropriate, and mostly
            natural in its interaction, successfully helping the user define a specific
            and challenging goal with an implementation intention.
