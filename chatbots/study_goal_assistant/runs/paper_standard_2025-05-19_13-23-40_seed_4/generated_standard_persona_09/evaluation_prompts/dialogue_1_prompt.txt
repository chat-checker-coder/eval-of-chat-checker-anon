Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to maintain physical health."
3. Chatbot: "Maintaining physical health is a wonderful goal and can have a positive impact on your overall well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
4. User: "I follow a regular exercise routine."
5. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a regular exercise routine! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health?**"
6. User: "Yes, but I seek improvement."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify a balanced diet plan that supports overall physical health.
2. Learn about different types of physical exercises and their benefits to create a personalized workout routine.
3. Study stress management techniques to understand how they impact physical health and incorporate them into daily life."
8. User: "I'll learn about balanced diets."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about balanced diets already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three balanced diet plans by Friday, 2025-05-23."
10. User: "I aim to find three plans by next Friday."
11. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "I'll choose the most practical plan."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying and choosing a balanced diet plan sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Choosing a diet plan today.
2. Identifying five diet plans by Wednesday.
3. Identifying ten diet plans before choosing one."
14. User: "I'll identify five plans by Wednesday."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the plans for a day before making your final choice?**"
16. User: "Yes, I could try that."
17. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! **Would you like to make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. User: "This level is right for me."
19. Chatbot: "It's great to see you setting a goal to identify and try out balanced diet plans. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.  
2. Watch 2 Youtube videos on nutrition tips.  
3. Consult a nutritionist for personalized advice."
20. User: "I'll read 3 articles first."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to start with. **Do you think reading these articles will give you enough information to identify five balanced diet plans by Wednesday?**"
22. User: "I believe it's a good start."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step towards understanding balanced diet plans. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading these articles? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans."
24. User: "If I make my morning coffee."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to make your morning coffee and read the articles?**"
26. User: "I'll start tomorrow morning."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be making your morning coffee tomorrow?** This will help solidify your cue."
28. User: "In my kitchen."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your balanced diet goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
30. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify five balanced diet plans by Wednesday, try implementing one for a day, and choose the most practical one by next Friday.

**Action:** Read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.

**Implementation Intention:** when I make my morning coffee in my kitchen tomorrow morning then read 3 articles on balanced diet plans."
32. User: "Thanks for the summary."
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
