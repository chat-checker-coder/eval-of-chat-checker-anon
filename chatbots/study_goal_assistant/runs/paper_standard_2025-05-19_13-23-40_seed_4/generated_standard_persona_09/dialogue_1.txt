Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd like to maintain physical health."
3. CHATBOT: "Maintaining physical health is a wonderful goal and can have a positive impact on your overall well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
4. USER: "I follow a regular exercise routine."
5. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a regular exercise routine! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but I seek improvement."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify a balanced diet plan that supports overall physical health.
2. Learn about different types of physical exercises and their benefits to create a personalized workout routine.
3. Study stress management techniques to understand how they impact physical health and incorporate them into daily life."
8. USER: "I'll learn about balanced diets."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning about balanced diets already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three balanced diet plans by Friday, 2025-05-23."
10. USER: "I aim to find three plans by next Friday."
11. CHATBOT: "**How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "I'll choose the most practical plan."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying and choosing a balanced diet plan sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Choosing a diet plan today.
2. Identifying five diet plans by Wednesday.
3. Identifying ten diet plans before choosing one."
14. USER: "I'll identify five plans by Wednesday."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the plans for a day before making your final choice?**"
16. USER: "Yes, I could try that."
17. CHATBOT: "That's fantastic! **Would you like to make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. USER: "This level is right for me."
19. CHATBOT: "It's great to see you setting a goal to identify and try out balanced diet plans. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.  
2. Watch 2 Youtube videos on nutrition tips.  
3. Consult a nutritionist for personalized advice."
20. USER: "I'll read 3 articles first."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan to start with. **Do you think reading these articles will give you enough information to identify five balanced diet plans by Wednesday?**"
22. USER: "I believe it's a good start."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great step towards understanding balanced diet plans. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading these articles? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans."
24. USER: "If I make my morning coffee."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to make your morning coffee and read the articles?**"
26. USER: "I'll start tomorrow morning."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Where will you be making your morning coffee tomorrow?** This will help solidify your cue."
28. USER: "In my kitchen."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your balanced diet goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
30. USER: "Sure, that sounds good!"
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify five balanced diet plans by Wednesday, try implementing one for a day, and choose the most practical one by next Friday.

**Action:** Read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.

**Implementation Intention:** when I make my morning coffee in my kitchen tomorrow morning then read 3 articles on balanced diet plans."
