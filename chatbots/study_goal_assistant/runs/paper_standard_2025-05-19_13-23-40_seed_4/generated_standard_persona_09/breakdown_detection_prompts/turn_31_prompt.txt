system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to maintain physical health."
3. Chatbot: "Maintaining physical health is a wonderful goal and can have a positive impact on your overall well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
4. User: "I follow a regular exercise routine."
5. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a regular exercise routine! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health?**"
6. User: "Yes, but I seek improvement."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of maintaining physical health. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify a balanced diet plan that supports overall physical health.
2. Learn about different types of physical exercises and their benefits to create a personalized workout routine.
3. Study stress management techniques to understand how they impact physical health and incorporate them into daily life."
8. User: "I'll learn about balanced diets."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about balanced diets already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three balanced diet plans by Friday, 2025-05-23."
10. User: "I aim to find three plans by next Friday."
11. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "I'll choose the most practical plan."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying and choosing a balanced diet plan sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Choosing a diet plan today.
2. Identifying five diet plans by Wednesday.
3. Identifying ten diet plans before choosing one."
14. User: "I'll identify five plans by Wednesday."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the plans for a day before making your final choice?**"
16. User: "Yes, I could try that."
17. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! **Would you like to make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. User: "This level is right for me."
19. Chatbot: "It's great to see you setting a goal to identify and try out balanced diet plans. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.  
2. Watch 2 Youtube videos on nutrition tips.  
3. Consult a nutritionist for personalized advice."
20. User: "I'll read 3 articles first."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to start with. **Do you think reading these articles will give you enough information to identify five balanced diet plans by Wednesday?**"
22. User: "I believe it's a good start."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step towards understanding balanced diet plans. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading these articles? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll read 3 articles on balanced diet plans.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 3 articles on balanced diet plans."
24. User: "If I make my morning coffee."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to make your morning coffee and read the articles?**"
26. User: "I'll start tomorrow morning."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be making your morning coffee tomorrow?** This will help solidify your cue."
28. User: "In my kitchen."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your balanced diet goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
30. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
