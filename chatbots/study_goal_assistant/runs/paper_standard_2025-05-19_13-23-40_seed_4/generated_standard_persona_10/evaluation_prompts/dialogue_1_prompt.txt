You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to launch a travel blog."
3. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! Launching a travel blog is an exciting venture that allows you to share your adventures and inspire others.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Established writing schedule  
- Strong social media presence  
- Experience in travel photography"
4. User: "I have writing skills, and I'm planning social media content."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid start with your writing skills and social media planning.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "I think it's a good start."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place with your writing skills and social media planning! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for launching your travel blog?**

For Example:
1. Publish 10 blog posts in the first month.
2. Gain 1,000 social media followers in three months.
3. Achieve 5,000 monthly blog visitors by six months."
8. User: "Publish 10 posts in a month."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of publishing 10 posts in a month already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Publish 10 posts by June 18th, 2025, 5 PM.'"
10. User: "Publish 10 posts by June 18, 2024."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of publishing 10 posts by June 18, 2024, sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Publishing 10 posts by May 25, 2024.  
2. Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024.  
3. Publishing 10 posts by May 18, 2024."
12. User: "Publishing 15 posts by June 18."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. User: "This is the right level."
15. Chatbot: "Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024, is an exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Write one blog post weekly.  
2. Research travel destinations monthly.  
3. Schedule weekly photo editing sessions.  "
16. User: "Write a blog outline daily."
17. Chatbot: "Writing a blog outline daily is a great way to stay organized and ensure you have a steady flow of content ideas. **Do you think this action will help you maintain consistency and creativity in your posts?**"
18. User: "Yes, it's perfect for both."
19. Chatbot: "That's fantastic to hear! Writing a blog outline daily will definitely help you maintain that consistency and creativity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will draft a blog outline.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll outline a blog post.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I will write a blog outline."
20. User: "When I finish lunch, I'll write."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start writing your blog outline?**"
22. User: "I usually have lunch at home."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having lunch at home can be a consistent and reliable cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish lunch at home, I'll write a blog outline"?**"
24. User: "Yes, that sounds perfect!"
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards publishing posts. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your blog outlines."
26. User: "Yes, I'd appreciate that!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024.

**Action:** Write a blog outline daily

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish lunch at home, I'll write a blog outline"
28. User: "Thank you so much for your guidance!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
