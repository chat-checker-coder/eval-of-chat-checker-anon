1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd like to launch a travel blog."
3. CHATBOT: "That's fantastic! Launching a travel blog is an exciting venture that allows you to share your adventures and inspire others.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Established writing schedule  
- Strong social media presence  
- Experience in travel photography"
4. USER: "I have writing skills, and I'm planning social media content."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid start with your writing skills and social media planning.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "I think it's a good start."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place with your writing skills and social media planning! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for launching your travel blog?**

For Example:
1. Publish 10 blog posts in the first month.
2. Gain 1,000 social media followers in three months.
3. Achieve 5,000 monthly blog visitors by six months."
8. USER: "Publish 10 posts in a month."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of publishing 10 posts in a month already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Publish 10 posts by June 18th, 2025, 5 PM.'"
10. USER: "Publish 10 posts by June 18, 2024."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of publishing 10 posts by June 18, 2024, sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Publishing 10 posts by May 25, 2024.  
2. Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024.  
3. Publishing 10 posts by May 18, 2024."
12. USER: "Publishing 15 posts by June 18."
13. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. USER: "This is the right level."
15. CHATBOT: "Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024, is an exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Write one blog post weekly.  
2. Research travel destinations monthly.  
3. Schedule weekly photo editing sessions.  "
16. USER: "Write a blog outline daily."
17. CHATBOT: "Writing a blog outline daily is a great way to stay organized and ensure you have a steady flow of content ideas. **Do you think this action will help you maintain consistency and creativity in your posts?**"
18. USER: "Yes, it's perfect for both."
19. CHATBOT: "That's fantastic to hear! Writing a blog outline daily will definitely help you maintain that consistency and creativity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will draft a blog outline.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll outline a blog post.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I will write a blog outline."
20. USER: "When I finish lunch, I'll write."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start writing your blog outline?**"
22. USER: "I usually have lunch at home."
23. CHATBOT: "Great! Having lunch at home can be a consistent and reliable cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish lunch at home, I'll write a blog outline"?**"
24. USER: "Yes, that sounds perfect!"
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards publishing posts. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your blog outlines."
26. USER: "Yes, I'd appreciate that!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Publishing 15 posts by June 18, 2024.

**Action:** Write a blog outline daily

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish lunch at home, I'll write a blog outline"
