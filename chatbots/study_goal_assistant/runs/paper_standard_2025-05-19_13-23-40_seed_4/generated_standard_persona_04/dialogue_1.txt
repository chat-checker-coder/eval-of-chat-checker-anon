Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm exploring career options."
3. CHATBOT: "Exploring career options sounds like a great start! **Does that mean your goal is to find a fulfilling career path, or are you striving for a higher goal like advancing in your current field, switching industries, or starting your own business?**"
4. USER: "I want a fulfilling career."
5. CHATBOT: "That's a wonderful aspiration! Finding a fulfilling career can lead to a more satisfying and balanced life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to discover and pursue this fulfilling career path?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry professionals  
- Regularly updating skills and resume  
- Seeking mentorship and guidance"
6. USER: "Not really sure where to start."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve finding a fulfilling career path. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different industries and job roles to understand which align with your interests and values.
2. Identify and develop skills that are in demand in the fields you are interested in.
3. Conduct informational interviews with professionals in careers you are considering to gain insights into their daily work and career satisfaction."
8. USER: "I like researching different industries."
9. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! Researching different industries can provide valuable insights into what might be a fulfilling career path for you. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. USER: "I'll explore industries weekly."
11. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! Exploring industries weekly can help you gain a broad understanding of various fields. 

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal?**"
12. USER: "Yes, let's make it official."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exploring different industries already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three industries weekly for career insights by June 30."
14. USER: "Research three industries by June."
15. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
16. USER: "Maybe, summarize insights in a journal?"
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to measure your progress! **When exactly in June do you want to complete this goal?**"
18. USER: "June 30 sounds reasonable."
19. CHATBOT: "Your goal of researching three industries and summarizing insights in a journal by June 30 sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Researching and summarizing one industry today.
2. Completing all research and summaries by June 15.
3. Increasing difficulty by analyzing five industries instead of three."
20. USER: "I think I'll stick with three."
21. CHATBOT: "Your goal of researching three industries and summarizing insights in a journal by June 30 is a great way to deepen your understanding. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read industry reports from reputable sources.  
2. Interview professionals in each industry.  
3. Attend webinars related to the industries."
22. USER: "Read industry reports this week."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid action to start with. **Do you want to proceed with reading industry reports this week as your action?**"
24. USER: "Yes, let's start with reports."
25. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Reading industry reports can be really insightful. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read an industry report.
2. When I log off from work at 5 PM, I'll dedicate 30 minutes to industry research.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I will read an industry report."
26. USER: "When I log off at 5 PM."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Where will you be when you log off from work at 5 PM?** It's important to have a clear location for your action."
28. USER: "I'll be at home."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards researching industries. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
30. USER: "Yes, that would be great!"
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research three industries and summarize insights in a journal by June 30.

**Action:** Read industry reports this week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I log off at 5 PM at home then read industry reports this week."
32. USER: "Thanks for your help! Looking forward."
