system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm exploring career options."
3. Chatbot: "Exploring career options sounds like a great start! **Does that mean your goal is to find a fulfilling career path, or are you striving for a higher goal like advancing in your current field, switching industries, or starting your own business?**"
4. User: "I want a fulfilling career."
5. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful aspiration! Finding a fulfilling career can lead to a more satisfying and balanced life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to discover and pursue this fulfilling career path?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry professionals  
- Regularly updating skills and resume  
- Seeking mentorship and guidance"
6. User: "Not really sure where to start."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve finding a fulfilling career path. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different industries and job roles to understand which align with your interests and values.
2. Identify and develop skills that are in demand in the fields you are interested in.
3. Conduct informational interviews with professionals in careers you are considering to gain insights into their daily work and career satisfaction."
8. User: "I like researching different industries."
9. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Researching different industries can provide valuable insights into what might be a fulfilling career path for you. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "I'll explore industries weekly."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! Exploring industries weekly can help you gain a broad understanding of various fields. 

**Would you like to set this as your learning goal?**"
12. User: "Yes, let's make it official."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring different industries already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three industries weekly for career insights by June 30."
14. User: "Research three industries by June."
15. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
16. User: "Maybe, summarize insights in a journal?"
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to measure your progress! **When exactly in June do you want to complete this goal?**"
18. User: "June 30 sounds reasonable."
19. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching three industries and summarizing insights in a journal by June 30 sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Researching and summarizing one industry today.
2. Completing all research and summaries by June 15.
3. Increasing difficulty by analyzing five industries instead of three."
20. User: "I think I'll stick with three."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching three industries and summarizing insights in a journal by June 30 is a great way to deepen your understanding. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read industry reports from reputable sources.  
2. Interview professionals in each industry.  
3. Attend webinars related to the industries."
22. User: "Read industry reports this week."
