        content: Great choice! Watching the videos on Thursday will give you time
            to apply the strategies before your goal deadline on Friday. **Where will
            you be making your evening tea on Thursday?**
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance asks the user about the location
                where they will be making their evening tea on Thursday. This question
                seems unnecessary and does not contribute to the goal-setting process.
                The location of making tea is irrelevant to the task of watching YouTube
                videos for learning task prioritization strategies. This can be seen
                as a lack of brevity, as the question does not add value to the conversation
                and could potentially confuse the user. The chatbot should focus on
                ensuring the user is prepared to watch the videos and apply the strategies,
                rather than asking about the location of making tea.

            This will help solidify your cue.
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance asks the user about the location
                where they will be making their morning coffee. This question is intended
                to help the user solidify their cue for reading articles on balanced
                diet plans. However, the question about the location seems unnecessary
                and does not contribute significantly to the goal-setting process.
                The user has already established a cue (making morning coffee) and
                a time (tomorrow morning) for reading the articles. Asking about the
                location does not add value to the conversation and may confuse the
                user as to why this detail is important. This can be seen as a lack
                of brevity, as the chatbot is introducing an unnecessary detail that
                does not aid in achieving the user's goal.
