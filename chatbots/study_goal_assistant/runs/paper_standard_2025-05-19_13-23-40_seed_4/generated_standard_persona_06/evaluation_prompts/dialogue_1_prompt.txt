system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Develop leadership skills for promotion."
3. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal! Developing leadership skills can open up many opportunities for growth and advancement in your career. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops  
- Seek mentorship from leaders  
- Lead team projects"
4. User: "Attend workshops and seek mentorship."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but open to more."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for developing your leadership skills for promotion?**

For Example:
1. Lead a team project successfully by Q2.
2. Present at two leadership workshops by year-end.
3. Mentor a junior colleague for six months."
8. User: "Lead a project this quarter."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of leading a project already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete project by July 31st with 10% cost reduction.'"
10. User: "Complete project by June 30th."
11. Chatbot: "**How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Meet deadlines and stay on budget."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing the project by June 30th, meeting deadlines and staying on budget sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Finalizing the project plan today.  
2. Completing the project by June 15th.  
3. Increasing difficulty by reducing the budget by 10%."
14. User: "Completing by June 15th works."
15. Chatbot: "Great! Completing the project by June 15th is a more challenging goal. 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the limit for now?**"
16. User: "This is the limit for now."
17. Chatbot: "Completing the project by June 15th while meeting deadlines and staying on budget is a great goal. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Create a detailed project timeline and checklist.  
2. Schedule weekly progress meetings with the team.  
3. Monitor expenses weekly to ensure budget adherence."
18. User: "Create a detailed project timeline."
19. Chatbot: "Creating a detailed project timeline is a great action to ensure you meet deadlines. **Do you think this is the best action to start with, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "This is the best start."
21. Chatbot: "Creating a detailed project timeline is a fantastic way to stay organized and on track. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will create a detailed project timeline.
2. When I sit down at my desk each morning, I'll draft a project timeline.
3. If I complete my daily team meeting, I will update the project timeline."
22. User: "When I sit down at my desk."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! Sitting down at your desk is a reliable and noticeable event. **Could you specify a concrete day or days when this should happen within the next 7 days?**"
24. User: "Tomorrow and Friday this week."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You've chosen specific days which will help in making this intention more concrete. **Could you confirm the location where this action will take place?**"
26. User: "My office at work."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing your project. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your timeline."
28. User: "Sure, that sounds great."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete project by June 15th, meeting deadlines and staying on budget.

**Action:** Create a detailed project timeline.

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down at my desk in my office at work tomorrow and Friday this week, then create a detailed project timeline."
30. User: "Thanks for your help!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
