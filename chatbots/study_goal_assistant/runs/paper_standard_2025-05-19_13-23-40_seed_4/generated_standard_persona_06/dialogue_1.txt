Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Develop leadership skills for promotion."
3. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic goal! Developing leadership skills can open up many opportunities for growth and advancement in your career. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops  
- Seek mentorship from leaders  
- Lead team projects"
4. USER: "Attend workshops and seek mentorship."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but open to more."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for developing your leadership skills for promotion?**

For Example:
1. Lead a team project successfully by Q2.
2. Present at two leadership workshops by year-end.
3. Mentor a junior colleague for six months."
8. USER: "Lead a project this quarter."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of leading a project already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete project by July 31st with 10% cost reduction.'"
10. USER: "Complete project by June 30th."
11. CHATBOT: "**How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "Meet deadlines and stay on budget."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing the project by June 30th, meeting deadlines and staying on budget sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Finalizing the project plan today.  
2. Completing the project by June 15th.  
3. Increasing difficulty by reducing the budget by 10%."
14. USER: "Completing by June 15th works."
15. CHATBOT: "Great! Completing the project by June 15th is a more challenging goal. 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the limit for now?**"
16. USER: "This is the limit for now."
17. CHATBOT: "Completing the project by June 15th while meeting deadlines and staying on budget is a great goal. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Create a detailed project timeline and checklist.  
2. Schedule weekly progress meetings with the team.  
3. Monitor expenses weekly to ensure budget adherence."
18. USER: "Create a detailed project timeline."
19. CHATBOT: "Creating a detailed project timeline is a great action to ensure you meet deadlines. **Do you think this is the best action to start with, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. USER: "This is the best start."
21. CHATBOT: "Creating a detailed project timeline is a fantastic way to stay organized and on track. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will create a detailed project timeline.
2. When I sit down at my desk each morning, I'll draft a project timeline.
3. If I complete my daily team meeting, I will update the project timeline."
22. USER: "When I sit down at my desk."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a great cue! Sitting down at your desk is a reliable and noticeable event. **Could you specify a concrete day or days when this should happen within the next 7 days?**"
24. USER: "Tomorrow and Friday this week."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You've chosen specific days which will help in making this intention more concrete. **Could you confirm the location where this action will take place?**"
26. USER: "My office at work."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing your project. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your timeline."
28. USER: "Sure, that sounds great."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete project by June 15th, meeting deadlines and staying on budget.

**Action:** Create a detailed project timeline.

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down at my desk in my office at work tomorrow and Friday this week, then create a detailed project timeline."
