Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to balance studies and social life."
3. CHATBOT: "Balancing studies and social life is a wonderful goal that can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time management skills  
- Prioritize tasks effectively  
- Set clear boundaries"
4. USER: "I try to prioritize tasks."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid approach. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "It could use some improvement."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve balance between studies and social life. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research time management techniques to effectively allocate time for both studies and social activities.
2. Learn about setting priorities and boundaries to maintain a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and social engagements.
3. Explore strategies for effective communication to negotiate and plan social activities around study commitments."
8. USER: "Learn time management techniques."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning time management techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three time management techniques by Friday, implement one."
10. USER: "Identify two techniques this week."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "I'll apply them on tasks."
13. CHATBOT: "Great! So your goal is to identify two time management techniques this week and apply them to tasks. **When exactly this week do you want to achieve this goal?**"
14. USER: "By Saturday evening."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of balancing studies and social life sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying two techniques and applying them today.  
2. Applying techniques to all tasks by Friday evening.  
3. Identifying four techniques before choosing two to apply."
16. USER: "I'll identify four techniques."
17. CHATBOT: "Great! Identifying four techniques will give you a broader perspective on time management. **Do you think you could apply these techniques to all your tasks by Friday evening instead of Saturday?**"
18. USER: "I can try for Friday."
19. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic approach! Applying the techniques by Friday will give you a head start on the weekend. **Do you think you could also track your progress and reflect on the effectiveness of these techniques by Sunday?**"
20. USER: "Yes, I can do that."
21. CHATBOT: "It's great to see your commitment to improving your time management skills. Now that I know you want to identify and apply time management techniques, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on time management strategies.  
2. Watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.  
3. Attend a webinar on effective time management skills."
22. USER: "I'll watch 4 videos."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a practical and engaging way to learn new techniques. **Do you think watching these videos will provide you with the insights you need to apply the techniques effectively?**"
24. USER: "Yes, I believe so."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan to enhance your time management skills. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.
2. When I sit down at my desk after dinner, I'll watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.
3. If I complete my morning workout, I will watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques."
26. USER: "When I finish homework, I'll watch."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific day or days when you usually finish your homework, so you can consistently watch the videos?**"
28. USER: "I usually finish homework Monday."
29. CHATBOT: "Great! **Where do you usually finish your homework on Mondays, so you can have a clear location for your cue?**"
30. USER: "At my desk in my room."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards better time management. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
32. USER: "Yes, that sounds good."
33. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify four time management techniques by Saturday evening, apply them to all tasks by Friday, and track progress and reflect on their effectiveness by Sunday.

**Action:** Watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish homework at my desk in my room on Monday, I'll watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques."
34. USER: "Thanks! Looking forward to it."
35. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
