system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to balance studies and social life."
3. Chatbot: "Balancing studies and social life is a wonderful goal that can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time management skills  
- Prioritize tasks effectively  
- Set clear boundaries"
4. User: "I try to prioritize tasks."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It could use some improvement."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve balance between studies and social life. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research time management techniques to effectively allocate time for both studies and social activities.
2. Learn about setting priorities and boundaries to maintain a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and social engagements.
3. Explore strategies for effective communication to negotiate and plan social activities around study commitments."
8. User: "Learn time management techniques."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning time management techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three time management techniques by Friday, implement one."
10. User: "Identify two techniques this week."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "I'll apply them on tasks."
13. Chatbot: "Great! So your goal is to identify two time management techniques this week and apply them to tasks. **When exactly this week do you want to achieve this goal?**"
14. User: "By Saturday evening."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of balancing studies and social life sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying two techniques and applying them today.  
2. Applying techniques to all tasks by Friday evening.  
3. Identifying four techniques before choosing two to apply."
16. User: "I'll identify four techniques."
17. Chatbot: "Great! Identifying four techniques will give you a broader perspective on time management. **Do you think you could apply these techniques to all your tasks by Friday evening instead of Saturday?**"
18. User: "I can try for Friday."
19. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic approach! Applying the techniques by Friday will give you a head start on the weekend. **Do you think you could also track your progress and reflect on the effectiveness of these techniques by Sunday?**"
20. User: "Yes, I can do that."
21. Chatbot: "It's great to see your commitment to improving your time management skills. Now that I know you want to identify and apply time management techniques, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on time management strategies.  
2. Watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.  
3. Attend a webinar on effective time management skills."
22. User: "I'll watch 4 videos."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical and engaging way to learn new techniques. **Do you think watching these videos will provide you with the insights you need to apply the techniques effectively?**"
24. User: "Yes, I believe so."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan to enhance your time management skills. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.
2. When I sit down at my desk after dinner, I'll watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.
3. If I complete my morning workout, I will watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques."
26. User: "When I finish homework, I'll watch."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific day or days when you usually finish your homework, so you can consistently watch the videos?**"
28. User: "I usually finish homework Monday."
29. Chatbot: "Great! **Where do you usually finish your homework on Mondays, so you can have a clear location for your cue?**"
30. User: "At my desk in my room."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards better time management. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
32. User: "Yes, that sounds good."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify four time management techniques by Saturday evening, apply them to all tasks by Friday, and track progress and reflect on their effectiveness by Sunday.

**Action:** Watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish homework at my desk in my room on Monday, I'll watch 4 YouTube videos on time management techniques."
34. User: "Thanks! Looking forward to it."
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
