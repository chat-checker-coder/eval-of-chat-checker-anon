            on the goal-setting process. There were no unnecessary repetitions or
            digressions, and the user was able to define a clear goal and action plan
            within a reasonable number of turns.
        rating: 5
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and aligned with its purpose.
            It provided relevant examples and suggestions without overstepping its
            boundaries, such as giving medical advice or engaging in unrelated topics.
        rating: 5
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were mostly natural, though slightly structured
            and formal. However, this is acceptable given the task-oriented nature
            of the interaction. The language was clear and supportive, which is suitable
            for a goal-setting assistant.
        rating: 4
