1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to improve my fitness."

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Personal fitness trainer"
4. USER: "I don't have a plan yet."
5. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your fitness improvement. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines and identify which ones align with your fitness goals.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness improvement.
3. Study techniques for tracking progress and setting realistic fitness milestones."
6. USER: "I want to learn exercises."
7. CHATBOT: "That's a great learning goal! **What specific type of exercises are you interested in learning about, such as strength training, cardio, flexibility, or something else?**"
8. USER: "I'm interested in cardio exercises."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning about different types of cardio exercises already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

Master 3 cardio exercises by May 26, 2025."

15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **What specific distance and time would you like to achieve by June next year to consider jogging mastered?**"
16. USER: "5 km in 30 minutes."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of mastering jogging sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.
