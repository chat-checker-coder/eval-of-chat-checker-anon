    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were mostly natural, with clear and supportive
            language. However, some responses were slightly formulaic, such as repeatedly
            asking if the user could make the goal more challenging. Despite this,
            the overall tone was encouraging and aligned with the task-oriented nature
            of the chatbot.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed very well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It was successful in helping the user define
            a specific, measurable, and challenging goal, and it maintained an appropriate
            and efficient dialogue throughout. Minor issues in naturalness slightly
            affected the overall performance, but the task was completed effectively.
