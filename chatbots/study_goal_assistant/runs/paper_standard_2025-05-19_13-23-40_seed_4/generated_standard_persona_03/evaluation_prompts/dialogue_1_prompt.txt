You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to improve my fitness."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your fitness is a fantastic goal! It can have such a positive impact on your overall health and well-being. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Personal fitness trainer"
4. User: "I don't have a plan yet."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your fitness improvement. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines and identify which ones align with your fitness goals.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness improvement.
3. Study techniques for tracking progress and setting realistic fitness milestones."
6. User: "I want to learn exercises."
7. Chatbot: "That's a great learning goal! **What specific type of exercises are you interested in learning about, such as strength training, cardio, flexibility, or something else?**"
8. User: "I'm interested in cardio exercises."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about different types of cardio exercises already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master 3 cardio exercises by May 26, 2025."
10. User: "I'd like to master jogging."
11. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of mastering jogging?**"
12. User: "By June next year."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **How could you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure you've mastered jogging by June next year?**"
14. User: "I'll track distance and time."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **What specific distance and time would you like to achieve by June next year to consider jogging mastered?**"
16. User: "5 km in 30 minutes."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering jogging sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Running 5 km in 25 minutes by June.  
2. Achieving 5 km in 30 minutes by March.  
3. Running 10 km in 60 minutes by June."
18. User: "I think 5 km in 30 minutes by March is doable."
19. Chatbot: "Great! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the perfect balance for you?**"
20. User: "It's the perfect balance for me."
21. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal to master jogging by March! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Follow a 12-week running training plan.  
2. Watch 3 Youtube videos on running techniques.  
3. Read a book on improving running endurance.  "
22. User: "I'll start a jogging plan."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to take! **Do you think this jogging plan will help you achieve your goal of running 5 km in 30 minutes by March?**"
24. User: "Yes, I believe it will."
25. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of your jogging plan? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will put on my running shoes.
2. When I see the sunset, I will start my evening jog.
3. If I hear my morning alarm, I will head out for a jog."
26. User: "I'll jog after morning coffee."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days in the next 7 days when you plan to have your morning coffee and start jogging?**"
28. User: "I'll start on Monday and Thursday."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! **Where will you have your morning coffee before starting your jog?** This will help solidify your cue."
30. User: "likely in my kitchen."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering jogging. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your jogging plan."
32. User: "Yes, that would be helpful."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master jogging by March next year by running 5 km in 30 minutes.

**Action:** start a jogging plan

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen on Monday and Thursday, then I will start a jogging plan"
