system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to manage my stress."
3. Chatbot: "Managing stress sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving mental health, achieving work-life balance, or enhancing overall well-being. **Would you still like to keep managing stress as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I'd like overall well-being."
5. Chatbot: "Achieving overall well-being is a wonderful and holistic goal that can positively impact many areas of your life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to work towards this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Mindfulness meditation practice"
6. User: "I need help creating one."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve overall well-being. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and practice mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.
2. Learn about and incorporate balanced nutrition and exercise routines to enhance physical health.
3. Explore and implement stress management strategies to maintain a healthy work-life balance."
8. User: "I'll start with mindfulness."
9. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Mindfulness can significantly contribute to overall well-being. 

**How would you like to formulate your learning goal around mindfulness?** For example, "Learn and practice three mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.""
10. User: "Learn 3 mindfulness techniques weekly."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning 3 mindfulness techniques weekly already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore 3 mindfulness techniques by Friday, choose 2 favorites."
12. User: "Explore and practice 3 techniques weekly."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. User: "Every Sunday by noon."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'practicing mindfulness techniques' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Practicing 3 mindfulness techniques by today.
2. Practicing 5 techniques by Sunday noon.
3. Practicing 3 techniques daily until Sunday."
16. User: "I'll try 5 techniques weekly."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. User: "This is manageable for now."
19. Chatbot: "It's wonderful that you've set a manageable goal to explore and practice mindfulness techniques. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on mindfulness techniques.  
2. Watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness practices.  
3. Attend a mindfulness workshop or seminar.  "
20. User: "Watch 5 YouTube videos."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to start with! Watching videos can provide visual and practical insights into mindfulness techniques. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
22. User: "Proceed with watching videos."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! Watching videos on mindfulness techniques can be really beneficial. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
3. If I brew my morning coffee, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques."
24. User: "I'll watch videos after dinner."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
26. User: "In my living room."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to have dinner in your living room and watch the videos?**"
28. User: "Every evening from Monday to Friday."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exploring mindfulness. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
30. User: "Yes, I would appreciate that."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Explore and practice 5 mindfulness techniques every week by Sunday noon.

**Action:** Watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** when I have dinner in my living room every evening from Monday to Friday then watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques."
32. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
