    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed excellently in guiding the user
            through the goal-setting process. It was effective, efficient, and appropriate,
            with only minor issues in naturalness. The user was able to set a clear
            goal and action plan, which is the primary objective of the chatbot.
