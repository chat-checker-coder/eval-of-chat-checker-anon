system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to manage my stress."
3. Chatbot: "Managing stress sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving mental health, achieving work-life balance, or enhancing overall well-being. **Would you still like to keep managing stress as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I'd like overall well-being."
5. Chatbot: "Achieving overall well-being is a wonderful and holistic goal that can positively impact many areas of your life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to work towards this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Mindfulness meditation practice"
6. User: "I need help creating one."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve overall well-being. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and practice mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.
2. Learn about and incorporate balanced nutrition and exercise routines to enhance physical health.
3. Explore and implement stress management strategies to maintain a healthy work-life balance."
8. User: "I'll start with mindfulness."
9. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Mindfulness can significantly contribute to overall well-being. 

**How would you like to formulate your learning goal around mindfulness?** For example, "Learn and practice three mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.""
10. User: "Learn 3 mindfulness techniques weekly."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning 3 mindfulness techniques weekly already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore 3 mindfulness techniques by Friday, choose 2 favorites."
12. User: "Explore and practice 3 techniques weekly."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. User: "Every Sunday by noon."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'practicing mindfulness techniques' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Practicing 3 mindfulness techniques by today.
2. Practicing 5 techniques by Sunday noon.
3. Practicing 3 techniques daily until Sunday."
16. User: "I'll try 5 techniques weekly."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. User: "This is manageable for now."
19. Chatbot: "It's wonderful that you've set a manageable goal to explore and practice mindfulness techniques. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on mindfulness techniques.  
2. Watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness practices.  
3. Attend a mindfulness workshop or seminar.  "
20. User: "Watch 5 YouTube videos."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to start with! Watching videos can provide visual and practical insights into mindfulness techniques. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
22. User: "Proceed with watching videos."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! Watching videos on mindfulness techniques can be really beneficial. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
3. If I brew my morning coffee, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques."
24. User: "I'll watch videos after dinner."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
26. User: "In my living room."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to have dinner in your living room and watch the videos?**"
28. User: "Every evening from Monday to Friday."

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exploring mindfulness. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
