Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to manage my stress."
3. CHATBOT: "Managing stress sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving mental health, achieving work-life balance, or enhancing overall well-being. **Would you still like to keep managing stress as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "I'd like overall well-being."
5. CHATBOT: "Achieving overall well-being is a wonderful and holistic goal that can positively impact many areas of your life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to work towards this goal?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Mindfulness meditation practice"
6. USER: "I need help creating one."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve overall well-being. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and practice mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.
2. Learn about and incorporate balanced nutrition and exercise routines to enhance physical health.
3. Explore and implement stress management strategies to maintain a healthy work-life balance."
8. USER: "I'll start with mindfulness."
9. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! Mindfulness can significantly contribute to overall well-being. 

**How would you like to formulate your learning goal around mindfulness?** For example, "Learn and practice three mindfulness techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.""
10. USER: "Learn 3 mindfulness techniques weekly."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning 3 mindfulness techniques weekly already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore 3 mindfulness techniques by Friday, choose 2 favorites."
12. USER: "Explore and practice 3 techniques weekly."
13. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. USER: "Every Sunday by noon."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'practicing mindfulness techniques' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Practicing 3 mindfulness techniques by today.
2. Practicing 5 techniques by Sunday noon.
3. Practicing 3 techniques daily until Sunday."
16. USER: "I'll try 5 techniques weekly."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you now?**"
18. USER: "This is manageable for now."
19. CHATBOT: "It's wonderful that you've set a manageable goal to explore and practice mindfulness techniques. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on mindfulness techniques.  
2. Watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness practices.  
3. Attend a mindfulness workshop or seminar.  "
20. USER: "Watch 5 YouTube videos."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great action to start with! Watching videos can provide visual and practical insights into mindfulness techniques. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
22. USER: "Proceed with watching videos."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! Watching videos on mindfulness techniques can be really beneficial. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.
3. If I brew my morning coffee, I will watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques."
24. USER: "I'll watch videos after dinner."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
26. USER: "In my living room."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to have dinner in your living room and watch the videos?**"
28. USER: "Every evening from Monday to Friday."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exploring mindfulness. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
30. USER: "Yes, I would appreciate that."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Explore and practice 5 mindfulness techniques every week by Sunday noon.

**Action:** Watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** when I have dinner in my living room every evening from Monday to Friday then watch 5 YouTube videos on mindfulness techniques."
32. USER: "Thanks for the summary!"
33. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
