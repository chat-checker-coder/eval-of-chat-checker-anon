system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Hey there! I'm looking to find a balance between my music career and establishing a consistent daily routine. Any ideas?"
3. Chatbot: "Finding balance between your music career and a daily routine sounds like a great goal! **Does that mean your goal is to create a balanced lifestyle, or are you striving for a higher goal like advancing your music career, improving time management, or enhancing personal well-being?**"
4. User: "Let's focus on a balanced lifestyle."
5. Chatbot: "Achieving a balanced lifestyle is a wonderful goal that can lead to greater happiness and well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you achieve this balanced lifestyle?**

For example:  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Healthy meal planning  
- Consistent sleep schedule"
6. User: "Not really, I'm winging it!"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve a balanced lifestyle. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different components of a balanced lifestyle, such as nutrition, exercise, and mental well-being, to understand how they contribute to overall health.
   
2. Learn about time management techniques to effectively allocate time for work, leisure, and self-care activities.

3. Explore mindfulness and stress-reduction practices to incorporate into daily routines for improved mental and emotional balance."
8. User: "I'll start with time management."
9. Chatbot: "Great choice! Time management is crucial for maintaining a balanced lifestyle. 

**What specific strategies or techniques would you like to learn about time management?**"
10. User: "I'd love tips on prioritizing."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of prioritizing tasks effectively already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three task prioritization strategies by Friday, 2025-05-23."
12. User: "How about by this Friday?"
13. Chatbot: "That sounds great! **How many strategies do you want to learn by this Friday?**"
14. User: "I'll learn two strategies."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning two task prioritization strategies sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Learning one strategy today.
2. Learning both strategies by Wednesday.
3. Identifying four strategies before choosing two."
16. User: "I'll stick with two."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning two task prioritization strategies by this Friday is a great step towards improving your productivity. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on task prioritization.  
2. Watch 2 YouTube videos on prioritization techniques.  
3. Attend a webinar on effective task management.  "
18. User: "I'll watch two YouTube videos!"
19. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Watching YouTube videos can be a quick and effective way to learn new strategies. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will watch two YouTube videos on task prioritization.
2. When I sit down at my desk after dinner, I'll watch two YouTube videos on task prioritization.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will watch two YouTube videos on task prioritization."
20. User: "When I make my evening tea."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! Making evening tea is a consistent and noticeable event. **On which day or days do you plan to watch the videos while making your evening tea?**"
22. User: "I'll watch them on Thursday."
23. Chatbot: "Great choice! Watching the videos on Thursday will give you time to apply the strategies before your goal deadline on Friday. **Where will you be making your evening tea on Thursday?**"
24. User: "In my cozy kitchen!"
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards learning strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
26. User: "Sure, sounds good to me!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Learn two task prioritization strategies by this Friday.

**Action:** Watch two YouTube videos on task prioritization strategies.

**Implementation Intention:** when I make my evening tea in my cozy kitchen on Thursday then watch two YouTube videos on task prioritization strategies."
28. User: "Thanks for the help! Can't wait!  "
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
