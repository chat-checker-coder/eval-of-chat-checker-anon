system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to learn guitar."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Learning to play the guitar can be such a rewarding and enjoyable experience. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent daily practice routine  
- Access to quality online lessons  
- Experienced guitar teacher guidance"
4. User: "I'm thinking of online lessons."
5. Chatbot: "Online lessons can be a great way to learn at your own pace and access a wide range of resources. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, I think it's good."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for learning guitar?**

For Example:
1. Master 5 songs in 3 months.
2. Play a song by ear in 2 weeks.
3. Perform at an open mic in 6 months."
8. User: "Master 5 songs in 3 months."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering 5 songs in 3 months already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Perform 5 songs flawlessly by August 19th.'"
10. User: "Perform 5 songs flawlessly by June."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in June do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By June 30th."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of performing 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Performing 5 songs flawlessly by May 31st.  
2. Mastering 7 songs flawlessly by June 30th.  
3. Performing 5 songs flawlessly by May 25th."
14. User: "I'll stick with June 30th."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of performing 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th is a great target to aim for. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Practice guitar for 1 hour daily.  
2. Take weekly guitar lessons with a teacher.  
3. Record and review performances weekly.  "
16. User: "Practice guitar for 1 hour daily."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to build consistency and improve your skills. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to consider another option?**"
18. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
19. Chatbot: "That's a great commitment to improving your guitar skills! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of practicing guitar for 1 hour daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish dinner, I will practice guitar for 1 hour.
2. When I return home from work, I'll immediately practice guitar for 1 hour.
3. After I make my morning coffee, I will practice guitar for 1 hour."
20. User: "When I return from work."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you plan to practice guitar after returning from work?**"
22. User: "The living room, it's spacious."
23. Chatbot: "Great choice! Practicing in a spacious living room can be very comfortable. **Is there a specific day or days in the next week when you plan to start this routine?**"
24. User: "I'll start next Monday."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards performing flawlessly. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily practice."
26. User: "Yes, that would be great."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Perform 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th.

**Action:** Practice guitar for 1 hour daily.

**Implementation Intention:** when I return from work to the living room next Monday then practice guitar for 1 hour daily."
28. User: "Thank you! Looking forward to it."
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
