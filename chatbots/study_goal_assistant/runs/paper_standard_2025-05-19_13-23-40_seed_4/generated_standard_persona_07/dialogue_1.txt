**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to learn guitar."
3. CHATBOT: "That's wonderful! Learning to play the guitar can be such a rewarding and enjoyable experience. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent daily practice routine  
- Access to quality online lessons  
- Experienced guitar teacher guidance"
4. USER: "I'm thinking of online lessons."
5. CHATBOT: "Online lessons can be a great way to learn at your own pace and access a wide range of resources. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, I think it's good."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for learning guitar?**

For Example:
1. Master 5 songs in 3 months.
2. Play a song by ear in 2 weeks.
3. Perform at an open mic in 6 months."
8. USER: "Master 5 songs in 3 months."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of mastering 5 songs in 3 months already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Perform 5 songs flawlessly by August 19th.'"
10. USER: "Perform 5 songs flawlessly by June."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in June do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. USER: "By June 30th."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of performing 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Performing 5 songs flawlessly by May 31st.  
2. Mastering 7 songs flawlessly by June 30th.  
3. Performing 5 songs flawlessly by May 25th."
14. USER: "I'll stick with June 30th."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of performing 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th is a great target to aim for. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Practice guitar for 1 hour daily.  
2. Take weekly guitar lessons with a teacher.  
3. Record and review performances weekly.  "
16. USER: "Practice guitar for 1 hour daily."
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan to build consistency and improve your skills. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to consider another option?**"
18. USER: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
19. CHATBOT: "That's a great commitment to improving your guitar skills! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of practicing guitar for 1 hour daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

1. If I finish dinner, I will practice guitar for 1 hour.
2. When I return home from work, I'll immediately practice guitar for 1 hour.
3. After I make my morning coffee, I will practice guitar for 1 hour."
20. USER: "When I return from work."

22. USER: "The living room, it's spacious."
23. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Practicing in a spacious living room can be very comfortable. **Is there a specific day or days in the next week when you plan to start this routine?**"
24. USER: "I'll start next Monday."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards performing flawlessly. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily practice."
26. USER: "Yes, that would be great."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Perform 5 songs flawlessly by June 30th.

**Action:** Practice guitar for 1 hour daily.

**Implementation Intention:** when I return from work to the living room next Monday then practice guitar for 1 hour daily."
