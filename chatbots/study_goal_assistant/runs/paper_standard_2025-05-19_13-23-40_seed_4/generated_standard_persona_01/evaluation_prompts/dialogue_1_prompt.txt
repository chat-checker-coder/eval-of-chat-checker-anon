system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to become a team leader in the next year."
3. Chatbot: "That's an exciting goal! Becoming a team leader is a fantastic opportunity to grow professionally and make a positive impact on your team.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops  
- Seek mentorship from leaders  
- Volunteer for team projects"
4. User: "Seek mentorship and lead projects."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but open to suggestions!"
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for becoming a team leader?**

For Example:
1. Lead 3 successful team projects by year-end.
2. Gain mentorship from 2 senior leaders.
3. Facilitate 5 team meetings effectively."
8. User: "Lead 3 successful projects."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of leading successful projects already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 3 projects by December 31st with 90% client satisfaction."
10. User: "Complete 3 projects by December."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Increase team efficiency by 20%."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of becoming a team leader sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Completing 3 projects by November 1st.
2. Achieving a 30% increase in team efficiency.
3. Completing 4 projects by December."
14. User: "I'll aim for 3 projects by November 1st."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
16. User: "This feels achievable, but hard."
17. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a challenging yet achievable goal of completing 3 projects by November 1st with a 20% increase in team efficiency. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Conduct weekly team efficiency workshops.  
2. Implement project management software for tracking progress.  
3. Schedule bi-weekly team feedback sessions."
18. User: "Implement project management software."
19. Chatbot: "Implementing project management software is a great step towards increasing team efficiency and tracking project progress. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
20. User: "It seems like the best action!"
21. Chatbot: "Implementing project management software is a fantastic choice to enhance your team's productivity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my workday at my desk, I will open the project management software.
2. When I finish my lunch break, I will update tasks in the project management software.
3. If I complete a team meeting, I will log action items in the project management software."
22. User: "When I start my workday."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great start! **Could you specify a concrete day and location where you will start your workday and implement the project management software?** This will help make your intention more actionable."
24. User: "I'll start this Monday at my office."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there anything else you would like to adjust or add to your implementation intention?** If not, I can finalize it for you."
26. User: "I'm all set, thanks!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing your projects. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your software implementation."
28. User: "That sounds great, thank you!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete 3 projects by November 1st with a 20% increase in team efficiency.

**Action:** Implement project management software

**Implementation Intention:** when I start my workday this Monday at my office then implement project management software"
30. User: "Thanks! Looking forward to it!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
