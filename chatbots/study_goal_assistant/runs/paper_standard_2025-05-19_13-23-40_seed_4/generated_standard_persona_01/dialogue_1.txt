Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to become a team leader in the next year."
3. CHATBOT: "That's an exciting goal! Becoming a team leader is a fantastic opportunity to grow professionally and make a positive impact on your team.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops  
- Seek mentorship from leaders  
- Volunteer for team projects"
4. USER: "Seek mentorship and lead projects."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but open to suggestions!"
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for becoming a team leader?**

For Example:
1. Lead 3 successful team projects by year-end.
2. Gain mentorship from 2 senior leaders.
3. Facilitate 5 team meetings effectively."
8. USER: "Lead 3 successful projects."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of leading successful projects already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 3 projects by December 31st with 90% client satisfaction."
10. USER: "Complete 3 projects by December."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "Increase team efficiency by 20%."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of becoming a team leader sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Completing 3 projects by November 1st.
2. Achieving a 30% increase in team efficiency.
3. Completing 4 projects by December."
14. USER: "I'll aim for 3 projects by November 1st."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
16. USER: "This feels achievable, but hard."
17. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a challenging yet achievable goal of completing 3 projects by November 1st with a 20% increase in team efficiency. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Conduct weekly team efficiency workshops.  
2. Implement project management software for tracking progress.  
3. Schedule bi-weekly team feedback sessions."
18. USER: "Implement project management software."
19. CHATBOT: "Implementing project management software is a great step towards increasing team efficiency and tracking project progress. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
20. USER: "It seems like the best action!"
21. CHATBOT: "Implementing project management software is a fantastic choice to enhance your team's productivity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my workday at my desk, I will open the project management software.
2. When I finish my lunch break, I will update tasks in the project management software.
3. If I complete a team meeting, I will log action items in the project management software."
22. USER: "When I start my workday."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! **Could you specify a concrete day and location where you will start your workday and implement the project management software?** This will help make your intention more actionable."
24. USER: "I'll start this Monday at my office."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there anything else you would like to adjust or add to your implementation intention?** If not, I can finalize it for you."
26. USER: "I'm all set, thanks!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing your projects. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your software implementation."
28. USER: "That sounds great, thank you!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete 3 projects by November 1st with a 20% increase in team efficiency.

**Action:** Implement project management software

**Implementation Intention:** when I start my workday this Monday at my office then implement project management software"
30. USER: "Thanks! Looking forward to it!"
