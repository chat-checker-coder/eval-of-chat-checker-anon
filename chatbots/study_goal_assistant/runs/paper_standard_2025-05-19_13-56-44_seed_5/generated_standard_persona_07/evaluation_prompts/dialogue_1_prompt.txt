system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Combining fitness with career goals."
3. Chatbot: "Combining fitness with career goals is a fantastic way to ensure a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. It shows your commitment to both personal health and professional success. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time management skills  
- Networking with fitness professionals  
- Setting clear, measurable goals"
4. User: "Using time blocks for both."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical approach to managing both fitness and career goals. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It works, but needs refining."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve combining fitness with career goals. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify career paths that align with your fitness interests and skills.
2. Learn about time management techniques to effectively balance fitness routines with career responsibilities.
3. Explore professional development opportunities in the fitness industry, such as certifications or workshops, to enhance your career prospects."
8. User: "Improve time management techniques."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of improving time management techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research five time management techniques by Friday, 2025-05-23."
10. User: "Research Pomodoro Technique by Friday."
11. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Apply technique to daily schedule."
13. Chatbot: "**When exactly do you want to apply the Pomodoro Technique to your daily schedule?**"
14. User: "Starting Monday morning."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching and applying the Pomodoro Technique sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Researching and choosing a strategy today.
2. Applying it to your schedule by Wednesday.
3. Or increasing the difficulty by identifying 5 strategies before choosing one."
16. User: "I'll research five techniques today."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step forward! **Do you think you could also try to implement one of those techniques by Thursday, or is that too much?**"
18. User: "Yes, I can implement one."
19. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! **Could you make it even more challenging by committing to track your progress and adjust the technique if needed by the end of the week?**"
20. User: "Sure, I can track progress."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to research and implement a Pomodoro technique, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read five articles on Pomodoro techniques.  
2. Watch tutorials on Pomodoro techniques on YouTube.  
3. Interview productivity experts about Pomodoro methods."
22. User: "Read five articles today."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid action to start with! **Do you want to proceed with reading five articles today as your action to achieve your goal?**"
24. User: "Yes, I'll start today."
25. Chatbot: "That's a great commitment to make! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading five articles today? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break, I will read one article on Pomodoro techniques.
2. When I sit at my desk after a meeting, I'll read an article on Pomodoro.
3. If I make my afternoon coffee, I will read an article on Pomodoro techniques."
26. User: "I'll read after lunch break."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your lunch break that could serve as a consistent reminder for you?**"
28. User: "I'll be at my desk."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your Pomodoro goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
30. User: "Yes, a check-in works!"
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research five Pomodoro techniques today, implement one by Thursday, and track progress to adjust the technique by the end of the week.

**Action:** Read five articles today.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch break at my desk then read five articles today."
32. User: "Great, I'm ready to start!"
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
