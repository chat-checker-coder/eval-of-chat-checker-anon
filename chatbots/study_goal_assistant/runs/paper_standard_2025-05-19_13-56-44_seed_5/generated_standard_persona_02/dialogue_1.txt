Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm aiming for a promotion."
3. CHATBOT: "That's an exciting goal! A promotion can open up new opportunities and challenges in your career. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong work performance  
- Networking with key stakeholders  
- Continuous skill development"
4. USER: "Mainly strong work performance."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid approach. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "It's good, but needs more."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your promotion. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research the skills and qualifications required for the desired position and identify areas for personal development.
2. Seek feedback from supervisors and colleagues to understand strengths and areas for improvement in your current role.
3. Learn about effective communication and leadership strategies to enhance your ability to lead and collaborate with others."
8. USER: "Learn leadership and communication skills."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning leadership and communication skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Develop three leadership strategies by June 2, 2025."
10. USER: "Develop two strategies by 2025."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in 2025 do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. USER: "By March 15, 2025."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of developing two leadership strategies by March 15, 2025, sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Developing two strategies by today.
2. Completing the goal by June 1, 2025.
3. Identifying four strategies before choosing two."
14. USER: "I'll aim for four strategies."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "I'll stick to four. It's realistic."
17. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a realistic goal to develop four leadership strategies by March 15, 2025. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:
1. Read 5 books on leadership strategies.
2. Attend 3 leadership workshops or seminars.
3. Interview 4 successful leaders for insights."
18. USER: "Read 2 leadership books."
19. CHATBOT: "Reading 2 leadership books is a great start to gaining insights and inspiration for developing your strategies. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
20. USER: "I'll stick with reading."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading 2 leadership books? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read a chapter from a leadership book.
2. When I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll read 10 pages of a leadership book.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will spend 30 minutes reading a leadership book."
22. USER: "I'll read after morning coffee."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could serve as a consistent place for reading?**"
24. USER: "I usually have coffee in my study."
25. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to start this routine?**"
26. USER: "I'll start tomorrow, daily."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards developing strategies. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
28. USER: "That sounds good to me!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Develop four leadership strategies by March 15, 2025.

**Action:** Read 2 leadership books

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in my study tomorrow, I'll read 2 leadership books"
30. USER: "Thanks for the summary!"
31. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
