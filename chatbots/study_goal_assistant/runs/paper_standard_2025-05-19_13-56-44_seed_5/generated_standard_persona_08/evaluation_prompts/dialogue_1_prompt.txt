system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Learn photography this year."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Photography is such a creative and rewarding skill to develop. **Do you already have a strategy or know the steps you need to take to learn photography?**

For example:  
- Enroll in a photography course  
- Practice daily with a camera  
- Join a photography club"
4. User: "Join a photography club."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of learning photography this year?**"
6. User: "Yes, it seems solid."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for learning photography this year?**

For Example:
1. Capture 50 high-quality photos by December.
2. Master manual camera settings by June.
3. Exhibit 10 photos in a local gallery."
8. User: "Capture 50 high-quality photos."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of capturing high-quality photos already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Capture 50 high-quality photos by June 30th, 2025."
10. User: "Capture 50 high-quality photos by year's end."
11. Chatbot: "**How could you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure the photos are high-quality?**"
12. User: "Consider peer reviews or gallery displays."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of capturing 50 high-quality photos sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Capturing 50 photos by September 30, 2025.
2. Capturing 100 photos by year's end.
3. Ensuring all photos are displayed in two galleries."
14. User: "Capture 100 photos by year's end."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This is the right level."
17. Chatbot: "Capturing 100 high-quality photos by year's end is an inspiring goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a photography workshop or class.  
2. Practice daily with different camera settings.  
3. Join a local photography club for feedback.  "
18. User: "Join a local photography club."
19. Chatbot: "Joining a local photography club is a fantastic step towards achieving your goal! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining the club? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee on Saturday, I will attend a photography club meeting.
2. When I see the sunset on Friday, I will sign up for a photography club event.
3. If I complete my weekly grocery shopping on Sunday, I will check the photography club schedule."
20. User: "If I finish breakfast Saturday, I'll sign up."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast on Saturdays that will help you remember to sign up for the photography club?**"
22. User: "Yes, at the local café."
23. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards capturing photos. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on joining the club."
24. User: "Sure, that sounds good."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Capture 100 high-quality photos by year's end, evaluated through peer reviews or gallery displays.

**Action:** Join a local photography club

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish breakfast at the local café on Saturday, I'll sign up for a local photography club"
26. User: "Thanks for your help!"
27. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
