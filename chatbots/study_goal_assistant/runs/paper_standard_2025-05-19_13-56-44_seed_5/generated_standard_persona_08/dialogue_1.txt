**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Learn photography this year."
3. CHATBOT: "That's wonderful! Photography is such a creative and rewarding skill to develop. **Do you already have a strategy or know the steps you need to take to learn photography?**

For example:  
- Enroll in a photography course  
- Practice daily with a camera  
- Join a photography club"
4. USER: "Join a photography club."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great step! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of learning photography this year?**"
6. USER: "Yes, it seems solid."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for learning photography this year?**

For Example:
1. Capture 50 high-quality photos by December.
2. Master manual camera settings by June.
3. Exhibit 10 photos in a local gallery."
8. USER: "Capture 50 high-quality photos."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of capturing high-quality photos already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Capture 50 high-quality photos by June 30th, 2025."
10. USER: "Capture 50 high-quality photos by year's end."
11. CHATBOT: "**How could you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure the photos are high-quality?**"
12. USER: "Consider peer reviews or gallery displays."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of capturing 50 high-quality photos sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Capturing 50 photos by September 30, 2025.
2. Capturing 100 photos by year's end.
3. Ensuring all photos are displayed in two galleries."
14. USER: "Capture 100 photos by year's end."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This is the right level."
17. CHATBOT: "Capturing 100 high-quality photos by year's end is an inspiring goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a photography workshop or class.  
2. Practice daily with different camera settings.  
3. Join a local photography club for feedback.  "
18. USER: "Join a local photography club."
19. CHATBOT: "Joining a local photography club is a fantastic step towards achieving your goal! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining the club? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee on Saturday, I will attend a photography club meeting.
2. When I see the sunset on Friday, I will sign up for a photography club event.
3. If I complete my weekly grocery shopping on Sunday, I will check the photography club schedule."
20. USER: "If I finish breakfast Saturday, I'll sign up."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast on Saturdays that will help you remember to sign up for the photography club?**"
22. USER: "Yes, at the local café."
23. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards capturing photos. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on joining the club."
24. USER: "Sure, that sounds good."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Capture 100 high-quality photos by year's end, evaluated through peer reviews or gallery displays.

**Action:** Join a local photography club

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish breakfast at the local café on Saturday, I'll sign up for a local photography club"
