system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm interested in implementing new teaching strategies."
3. Chatbot: "Implementing new teaching strategies sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing student engagement, improving learning outcomes, or becoming a more effective educator. **Would you still like to keep implementing new teaching strategies as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, let's focus on that."
5. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful focus! Implementing new teaching strategies can significantly impact both your teaching effectiveness and your students' learning experiences. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Interactive technology integration  
- Collaborative group activities  
- Gamified learning experiences"
6. User: "I'm considering interactive technology integration."
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a promising approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Yes, it complements modern learning."
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for enhancing student engagement through interactive technology integration?**

For Example:
1. Increase student participation by 30% using interactive technology.
2. Boost student feedback scores by 20% with new strategies.
3. Achieve 90% student satisfaction through tech-enhanced lessons."
10. User: "I aim for 30% more participation."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of increasing student participation already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Boost student participation by 30% using tech by Dec 2025.'"
12. User: "Boost participation by 30% by 2024."
13. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the increase in student participation using interactive technology?**"
14. User: "I'll track attendance and engagement."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of boosting student participation sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Achieving a 50% boost by December 31, 2024.
2. Reaching a 30% boost by June 30, 2024.
3. Implementing three interactive technologies by December 31, 2024."
16. User: "I'll aim for a 50% boost."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most ambitious yet achievable goal for you?**"
18. User: "I think 50% is ambitious."
19. Chatbot: "Boosting student participation by 50% using interactive technology is indeed an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Implement gamified quizzes in lessons.  
2. Use virtual reality for immersive learning experiences.  
3. Conduct live polls during class discussions.  "
20. User: "I'll try conducting live polls."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to engage students and track their participation! **Do you think conducting live polls is the best action to start with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
22. User: "Yes, I'll start with polls."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan to enhance class engagement! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of conducting live polls during class discussions? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start a new class session, I will conduct a live poll immediately.
2. When I see students settling into their seats, I'll initiate a live poll.
3. If I notice a lull in class discussion, I will launch a live poll."
24. User: "I'll launch a poll when discussions lull."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific day or days when you usually notice lulls in class discussions?** This will help make the cue more concrete and actionable."
26. User: "I usually notice it on Fridays."
27. Chatbot: "Great! **Where do these class discussions typically take place?** Knowing the location will help solidify your cue."
28. User: "They take place in my classroom."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards boosting participation. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your live polls."
30. User: "Yes, that sounds good!"
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Boost student participation by 50% using interactive technology by tracking attendance and engagement by December 31, 2024.

**Action:** Conducting live polls during class discussions

**Implementation Intention:** when I notice a lull in class discussions on Fridays in my classroom then I will launch a poll"
32. User: "Thank you for the summary!"
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
