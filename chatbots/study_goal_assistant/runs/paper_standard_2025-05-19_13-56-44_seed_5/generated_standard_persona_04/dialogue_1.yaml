            question redundant and could confuse the user, as it does not contribute
            to the task at hand. Therefore, this is a case of redundancy, as the chatbot

        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed very well, successfully guiding
            the user through the goal-setting process with appropriate, efficient,
            and mostly natural interactions. The minor issues in naturalness slightly
            affected the overall performance, but the task was completed effectively.
