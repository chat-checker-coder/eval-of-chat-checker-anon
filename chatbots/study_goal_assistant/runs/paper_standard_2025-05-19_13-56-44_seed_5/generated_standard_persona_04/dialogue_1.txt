Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm interested in implementing new teaching strategies."
3. CHATBOT: "Implementing new teaching strategies sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing student engagement, improving learning outcomes, or becoming a more effective educator. **Would you still like to keep implementing new teaching strategies as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Yes, let's focus on that."
5. CHATBOT: "That's a wonderful focus! Implementing new teaching strategies can significantly impact both your teaching effectiveness and your students' learning experiences. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Interactive technology integration  
- Collaborative group activities  
- Gamified learning experiences"
6. USER: "I'm considering interactive technology integration."
7. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a promising approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. USER: "Yes, it complements modern learning."
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for enhancing student engagement through interactive technology integration?**

For Example:
1. Increase student participation by 30% using interactive technology.
2. Boost student feedback scores by 20% with new strategies.
3. Achieve 90% student satisfaction through tech-enhanced lessons."
10. USER: "I aim for 30% more participation."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of increasing student participation already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Boost student participation by 30% using tech by Dec 2025.'"
12. USER: "Boost participation by 30% by 2024."
13. CHATBOT: "**How will you measure the increase in student participation using interactive technology?**"
14. USER: "I'll track attendance and engagement."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of boosting student participation sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Achieving a 50% boost by December 31, 2024.
2. Reaching a 30% boost by June 30, 2024.
3. Implementing three interactive technologies by December 31, 2024."
16. USER: "I'll aim for a 50% boost."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most ambitious yet achievable goal for you?**"
18. USER: "I think 50% is ambitious."
19. CHATBOT: "Boosting student participation by 50% using interactive technology is indeed an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Implement gamified quizzes in lessons.  
2. Use virtual reality for immersive learning experiences.  
3. Conduct live polls during class discussions.  "
20. USER: "I'll try conducting live polls."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to engage students and track their participation! **Do you think conducting live polls is the best action to start with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
22. USER: "Yes, I'll start with polls."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan to enhance class engagement! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of conducting live polls during class discussions? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start a new class session, I will conduct a live poll immediately.
2. When I see students settling into their seats, I'll initiate a live poll.
3. If I notice a lull in class discussion, I will launch a live poll."
24. USER: "I'll launch a poll when discussions lull."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific day or days when you usually notice lulls in class discussions?** This will help make the cue more concrete and actionable."
26. USER: "I usually notice it on Fridays."
27. CHATBOT: "Great! **Where do these class discussions typically take place?** Knowing the location will help solidify your cue."
28. USER: "They take place in my classroom."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards boosting participation. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your live polls."
30. USER: "Yes, that sounds good!"
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Boost student participation by 50% using interactive technology by tracking attendance and engagement by December 31, 2024.

**Action:** Conducting live polls during class discussions

**Implementation Intention:** when I notice a lull in class discussions on Fridays in my classroom then I will launch a poll"
32. USER: "Thank you for the summary!"
33. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
