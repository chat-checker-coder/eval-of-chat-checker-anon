system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I aim to lead tech projects."
3. Chatbot: "That's an exciting goal! Leading tech projects can be incredibly rewarding and a great opportunity to make a significant impact.

**Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong project management skills  
- Experience in agile methodologies  
- Technical expertise in relevant field"
4. User: "I have some project management skills."
5. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Having project management skills is definitely beneficial.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of leading tech projects?**"
6. User: "It needs more depth, especially in leadership."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of leading tech projects. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research effective project management methodologies and tools used in leading tech projects.
2. Develop skills in communication and team leadership to effectively manage and motivate a tech team.
3. Learn about risk management strategies specific to technology projects to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges."
8. User: "Develop skills in team leadership."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of developing skills in team leadership already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Implement three team leadership strategies by June 30, 2025.'"
10. User: "Implement two leadership strategies by December 2024."
11. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the success of implementing these two leadership strategies?**"
12. User: "By team feedback and project outcomes."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'implementing leadership strategies' sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Implementing two strategies by June 2024.  
2. Gathering team feedback by March 2024.  
3. Increasing difficulty by implementing three strategies."
14. User: "I'll aim for three strategies."
15. Chatbot: "It's great to see your commitment to implementing three leadership strategies by December 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three books on leadership strategies.  
2. Attend a leadership workshop or seminar.  
3. Interview successful tech project leaders.  "
16. User: "Attend a leadership workshop online."
17. Chatbot: "Attending a leadership workshop online is a great way to gain insights and learn new strategies. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or do you have another action in mind?**"
18. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with that."
19. Chatbot: "Attending a leadership workshop online is a fantastic choice for personal and professional growth. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will attend a leadership workshop online.
2. When I log off from my work computer at 5 PM, I'll join a leadership workshop.
3. If I complete my morning coffee routine, I will schedule a leadership workshop session."
20. User: "When I log off at 5 PM."
21. Chatbot: "Great choice! Logging off at 5 PM is a clear and consistent cue. **Where will you be when you log off at 5 PM?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific physical location."
22. User: "I'll be at my desk."
23. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards implementing strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workshop."
24. User: "Sure, a follow-up sounds helpful."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Implement three leadership strategies by December 2024, measured by team feedback and project outcomes.

**Action:** Attend a leadership workshop online.

**Implementation Intention:** when I log off at 5 PM at my desk then attend a leadership workshop online."
26. User: "Thanks! Looking forward to progress."
