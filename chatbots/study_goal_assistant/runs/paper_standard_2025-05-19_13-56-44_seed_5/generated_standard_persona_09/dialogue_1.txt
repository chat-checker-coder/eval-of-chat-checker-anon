Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I aim to lead tech projects."
3. CHATBOT: "That's an exciting goal! Leading tech projects can be incredibly rewarding and a great opportunity to make a significant impact.

**Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong project management skills  
- Experience in agile methodologies  
- Technical expertise in relevant field"
4. USER: "I have some project management skills."
5. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! Having project management skills is definitely beneficial.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of leading tech projects?**"
6. USER: "It needs more depth, especially in leadership."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of leading tech projects. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research effective project management methodologies and tools used in leading tech projects.
2. Develop skills in communication and team leadership to effectively manage and motivate a tech team.
3. Learn about risk management strategies specific to technology projects to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges."
8. USER: "Develop skills in team leadership."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of developing skills in team leadership already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Implement three team leadership strategies by June 30, 2025.'"
10. USER: "Implement two leadership strategies by December 2024."
11. CHATBOT: "**How will you measure the success of implementing these two leadership strategies?**"
12. USER: "By team feedback and project outcomes."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'implementing leadership strategies' sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Implementing two strategies by June 2024.  
2. Gathering team feedback by March 2024.  
3. Increasing difficulty by implementing three strategies."
14. USER: "I'll aim for three strategies."
15. CHATBOT: "It's great to see your commitment to implementing three leadership strategies by December 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three books on leadership strategies.  
2. Attend a leadership workshop or seminar.  
3. Interview successful tech project leaders.  "
16. USER: "Attend a leadership workshop online."
17. CHATBOT: "Attending a leadership workshop online is a great way to gain insights and learn new strategies. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or do you have another action in mind?**"
18. USER: "Yes, I'll proceed with that."
19. CHATBOT: "Attending a leadership workshop online is a fantastic choice for personal and professional growth. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will attend a leadership workshop online.
2. When I log off from my work computer at 5 PM, I'll join a leadership workshop.
3. If I complete my morning coffee routine, I will schedule a leadership workshop session."
20. USER: "When I log off at 5 PM."
21. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Logging off at 5 PM is a clear and consistent cue. **Where will you be when you log off at 5 PM?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific physical location."
22. USER: "I'll be at my desk."
23. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards implementing strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workshop."
24. USER: "Sure, a follow-up sounds helpful."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Implement three leadership strategies by December 2024, measured by team feedback and project outcomes.

**Action:** Attend a leadership workshop online.

**Implementation Intention:** when I log off at 5 PM at my desk then attend a leadership workshop online."
26. USER: "Thanks! Looking forward to progress."
