        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance suggests that the user's goal
                lacks a specific time frame, even though the user has already specified
                "by year-end." The chatbot's request for a more concrete time is redundant
                because the user has already provided a clear time frame. This leads
                to a breakdown as it may confuse the user or make them feel that their
                input was not acknowledged. The breakdown types that apply here are
                "Redundancy" and "Ignore expectation," as the chatbot fails to recognize
                the user's already specified time frame and asks for information that
                has already been provided.

            challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can''t, this
            is also okay.


            You could make your goal challenging by:

            1. Developing two strategies by today.

            2. Completing the goal by June 1, 2025.

            3. Identifying four strategies before choosing two.'
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: 'The chatbot''s latest utterance acknowledges the user''s goal
                and suggests making it more challenging, which aligns with its purpose
                of helping users set specific and challenging goals. However, the
                examples provided by the chatbot are not well-suited to the user''s
                context. For instance, developing two strategies by today is unrealistic,
                and completing the goal by June 1, 2025, is less challenging than
                the user''s original deadline of March 15, 2025. Additionally, identifying
                four strategies before choosing two is not directly related to making
                the goal more challenging. These suggestions could confuse the user
                and disrupt the flow of the conversation, leading to a breakdown.


                The breakdown types identified are ''Semantic error'' because the
                examples do not logically align with the user''s goal, and ''Lack
                of clarity'' because the suggestions are not clear or relevant in
                making the goal more challenging.


                Overall, the chatbot''s response could lead to confusion and disrupt

                user will read "2 leadership books" after finishing their morning
                coffee, which is unrealistic and not what the user intended. The user
                planned to read after their morning coffee, but not to complete 2
                entire books in one sitting. This error could confuse the user and
                disrupt the flow of the conversation, as it misrepresents the user's

                it then asks the user if they think this strategy is already a good
                strategy to achieve their goal. This question could be seen as redundant
                because the user has already indicated that they are considering this
                strategy. The chatbot could have instead asked for more details about
                the portfolio or how the user plans to build it, which would have
                been more constructive in guiding the user towards their goal. Therefore,
                the question could lead to a slight dialogue breakdown due to redundancy
                and lack of progression in the conversation.

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance asks about the location of the
                class discussions, which seems unnecessary for the task of setting
                a goal and an implementation intention. The user has already provided
                a specific cue (lulls in class discussions on Fridays) for launching
                polls, and the location does not add value to the goal-setting process.
                This makes the question redundant and could confuse the user, as it
                does not contribute to the task at hand. Therefore, this is a case
                of redundancy, as the chatbot is asking for information that is not
                needed to proceed with the goal-setting process.

                six techniques, but the chatbot's summary states 'Identify and practice
                six stress management techniques weekly by February 2025,' which is
                not what the user specified. The user did not mention a specific deadline
                for identifying and practicing the techniques, only that they would
                watch two talks weekly. This constitutes a 'Wrong information' breakdown
                as the chatbot incorrectly summarizes the user's goal timeline. Additionally,
                the implementation intention is slightly misrepresented as it suggests
                watching two talks each week, whereas the user only committed to watching
                two talks weekly without specifying the exact number per session.
                This could also be seen as a 'Lack of clarity' issue. Despite these
                issues, the overall structure of the summary is clear, and the conversation
                can continue, but the inaccuracies need addressing.
