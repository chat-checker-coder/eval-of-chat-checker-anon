            at times. It used polite and encouraging language, which is suitable for
            a goal-setting assistant. However, the repeated use of phrases like 'that
            sounds like a great start' could be seen as slightly robotic.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed very well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It was successful in helping the user articulate
            a specific and challenging goal and formulate an implementation intention.
            Minor issues in naturalness slightly affected the overall performance,
            but it was still highly effective.
