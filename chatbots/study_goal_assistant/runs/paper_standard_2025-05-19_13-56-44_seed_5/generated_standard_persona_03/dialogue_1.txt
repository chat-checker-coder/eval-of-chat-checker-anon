**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm deciding on further studies or freelancing."
3. CHATBOT: "**Does that mean your goal is to make a decision between further studies and freelancing?** Or are you striving for a higher goal like advancing your career, gaining financial independence, or expanding your skill set?"
4. USER: "I'd like to advance my career."
5. CHATBOT: "Advancing your career is a fantastic goal and can open up many new opportunities for you. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

7. CHATBOT: "Building a portfolio is a great strategy to showcase your skills and achievements. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. USER: "Yes, I think so."
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for building your portfolio?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 new portfolio projects by year-end.
2. Secure 3 freelance clients within six months.
3. Publish 10 industry-related articles in one year."
10. USER: "Completing 5 projects by year-end."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing 5 projects by year-end already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 5 projects by December 31st, 2025."
12. USER: "Complete 5 projects by December 31st."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing 5 projects by December 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing 5 projects by November 30th.  
2. Completing 6 projects by December 31st.  
3. Completing 5 projects by December 15th."
14. USER: "Completing 6 projects by year-end!"
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This is the right level."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to complete 6 projects by December 31st, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Allocate 2 hours daily for project work.  
2. Attend a project management workshop.  
3. Collaborate with a mentor for guidance.  "
18. USER: "Allocate 2 hours daily."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think allocating 2 hours daily is the best action to help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
20. USER: "Yes, it's the best action."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great commitment! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of allocating 2 hours daily for project work? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at 2 PM, I will allocate 2 hours for project work.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll dedicate 2 hours to project tasks.
3. If I finish my morning coffee, I will spend 2 hours on project work."
22. USER: "When I finish lunch at 1 PM."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you plan to work on your projects after lunch?**"
24. USER: "At my home office."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing projects. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily work."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete 6 projects by December 31st.

**Action:** Allocate 2 hours daily for project work.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish lunch at 1 PM at my home office then allocate 2 hours daily for project work."
