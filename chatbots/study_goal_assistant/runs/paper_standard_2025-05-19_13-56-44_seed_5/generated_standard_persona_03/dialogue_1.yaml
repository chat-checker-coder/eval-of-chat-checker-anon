            the user has already indicated that they are considering this strategy.
            The chatbot could have instead asked for more details about the portfolio
            or how the user plans to build it, which would have been more constructive
            in guiding the user towards their goal. Therefore, the question could
            lead to a slight dialogue breakdown due to redundancy and lack of progression
