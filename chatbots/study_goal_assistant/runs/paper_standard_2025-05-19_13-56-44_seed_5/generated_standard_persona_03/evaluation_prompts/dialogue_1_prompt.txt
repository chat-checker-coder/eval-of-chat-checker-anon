system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm deciding on further studies or freelancing."
3. Chatbot: "**Does that mean your goal is to make a decision between further studies and freelancing?** Or are you striving for a higher goal like advancing your career, gaining financial independence, or expanding your skill set?"
4. User: "I'd like to advance my career."
5. Chatbot: "Advancing your career is a fantastic goal and can open up many new opportunities for you. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities"
6. User: "I'm considering building a portfolio."
7. Chatbot: "Building a portfolio is a great strategy to showcase your skills and achievements. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Yes, I think so."
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for building your portfolio?**

For Example:
1. Complete 5 new portfolio projects by year-end.
2. Secure 3 freelance clients within six months.
3. Publish 10 industry-related articles in one year."
10. User: "Completing 5 projects by year-end."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing 5 projects by year-end already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 5 projects by December 31st, 2025."
12. User: "Complete 5 projects by December 31st."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing 5 projects by December 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing 5 projects by November 30th.  
2. Completing 6 projects by December 31st.  
3. Completing 5 projects by December 15th."
14. User: "Completing 6 projects by year-end!"
15. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This is the right level."
17. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to complete 6 projects by December 31st, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Allocate 2 hours daily for project work.  
2. Attend a project management workshop.  
3. Collaborate with a mentor for guidance.  "
18. User: "Allocate 2 hours daily."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think allocating 2 hours daily is the best action to help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
20. User: "Yes, it's the best action."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great commitment! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of allocating 2 hours daily for project work? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at 2 PM, I will allocate 2 hours for project work.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll dedicate 2 hours to project tasks.
3. If I finish my morning coffee, I will spend 2 hours on project work."
22. User: "When I finish lunch at 1 PM."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you plan to work on your projects after lunch?**"
24. User: "At my home office."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards completing projects. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily work."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete 6 projects by December 31st.

**Action:** Allocate 2 hours daily for project work.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish lunch at 1 PM at my home office then allocate 2 hours daily for project work."
28. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
