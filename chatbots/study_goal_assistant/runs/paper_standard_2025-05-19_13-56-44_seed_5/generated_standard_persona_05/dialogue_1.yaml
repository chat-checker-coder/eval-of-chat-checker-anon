        reasoning: The chatbot's language was generally natural and encouraging, though
            at times it felt slightly repetitive and formulaic, especially with the
            repeated use of "Do you think..." and "That sounds like a...". This slightly
            reduced the natural flow of the conversation.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It was successful in helping the user define
            a specific and challenging goal and formulate an implementation intention.
            However, the efficiency could be improved by reducing the number of turns
            and making the conversation more concise.
