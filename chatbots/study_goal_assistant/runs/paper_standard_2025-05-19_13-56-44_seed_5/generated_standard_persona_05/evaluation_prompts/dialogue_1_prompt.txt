system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to write a novel."
3. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Writing a novel is an incredible creative journey and a significant accomplishment. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Detailed plot outline  
- Character development notes  
- Daily writing schedule"
4. User: "I have a vague plot outline."
5. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Having a plot outline can really help guide your writing process. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It needs more structure."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of writing a novel. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research the essential elements of novel writing, such as plot structure, character development, and setting creation.
   
2. Study different genres to understand their conventions and determine which genre aligns with your interests and writing style.

3. Learn about the writing process, including drafting, revising, and editing, to effectively organize and refine your novel."
8. User: "I want to study plot structures."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of studying plot structures already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Analyze three plot structures by Friday and summarize findings."
10. User: "Research two plot structures weekly."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to start and finish this weekly research?**"
12. User: "I'll start this weekend."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How will you measure the outcome of your weekly research on plot structures?**"
14. User: "Summarize findings in a notebook."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching plot structures sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Researching two plot structures today.
2. Summarizing findings by tomorrow.
3. Identifying four plot structures weekly."
16. User: "I'll try researching three weekly."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could also summarize your findings in a more detailed way, like creating a presentation or a detailed report each week?**"
18. User: "A detailed report sounds useful."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think you could also incorporate a practical application, like writing a short story using one of the plot structures each month?**"
20. User: "Writing a short story monthly sounds exciting!"
21. Chatbot: "It's great to see your enthusiasm for researching plot structures and writing short stories! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three books on plot structures.  
2. Watch expert interviews on plot development.  
3. Analyze plot structures in popular novels.  "
22. User: "I'll read a book on plot structures."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think reading a book on plot structures is the best action to start with, or is there another action you might consider?**"
24. User: "Yes, it's a good start."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading a book on plot structures? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish dinner each evening, I will read a book on plot structures.
2. When I sit down with my morning coffee, I'll read a book on plot structures.
3. If I complete my morning workout, I will read a book on plot structures."
26. User: "When the kids are in bed."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Do you have a specific location in mind where you'll read the book once the kids are in bed?**"
28. User: "I'll read in my cozy nook."
29. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to start reading in your cozy nook after the kids are in bed?**"
30. User: "Saturday and Sunday evenings."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your writing goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
32. User: "Sure, I'd appreciate that!"
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research three plot structures weekly starting this weekend, summarize findings in a detailed report, and write a short story using one of the plot structures each month.

**Action:** read a book on plot structures

**Implementation Intention:** when the kids are in bed on Saturday and Sunday evenings in my cozy nook then read a book on plot structures"
34. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
