# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm looking to advance in my career while maintaining my healthier lifestyle."
3. Chatbot: "That sounds like a wonderful and balanced goal! Advancing in your career while maintaining a healthier lifestyle can lead to both personal and professional fulfillment. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time management skills  
- Meal prepping routine  
- Regular exercise schedule"
4. User: "I've started meal prepping and jogging."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "I think it's a good start."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your career advancement and healthier lifestyle?**

For Example:
1. Complete a half marathon in under 2 hours.
2. Prepare 5 healthy meals weekly for 3 months.
3. Jog 20 miles weekly for 6 consecutive weeks."
8. User: "Get a promotion by year-end."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of getting a promotion already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Secure promotion by December 31st with 10% salary increase.'"
10. User: "Secure promotion with a 10% raise by year-end."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By December 31st."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of securing a promotion with a 10% raise by December 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Securing a 15% raise by December 31st.  
2. Achieving promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st.  
3. Securing promotion and raise by September 30th."
14. User: "Achieving it by October 31st."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "I think this is just right."
17. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to secure a promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Complete a leadership skills course online.  
2. Schedule weekly meetings with your manager for feedback.  
3. Prepare a presentation showcasing your recent achievements."
18. User: "I'll schedule a feedback meeting."
19. Chatbot: "Scheduling a feedback meeting is a great step to understand your current standing and areas for improvement. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "I think it's a great start."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great decision to move forward with. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of scheduling this feedback meeting? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my weekly report on Friday, I will schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.
2. When I receive my monthly performance review email, I'll immediately schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.
3. If I complete my Monday morning team meeting, I will schedule a feedback meeting with my manager."
22. User: "When I finish my weekly report."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid cue. **Is there a specific day and location where you usually finish your weekly report?** This will help make the cue more concrete and actionable."
24. User: "I usually finish it on Fridays at my desk."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your promotion. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on scheduling your feedback meeting."
26. User: "Yes, that would be great!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Secure promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st.

**Action:** Schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my weekly report on Fridays at my desk then schedule a feedback meeting with my manager."
28. User: "Thank you for your help!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
