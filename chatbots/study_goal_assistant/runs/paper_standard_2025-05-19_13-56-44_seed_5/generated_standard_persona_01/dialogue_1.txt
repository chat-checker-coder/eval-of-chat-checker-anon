Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm looking to advance in my career while maintaining my healthier lifestyle."
3. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a wonderful and balanced goal! Advancing in your career while maintaining a healthier lifestyle can lead to both personal and professional fulfillment. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time management skills  
- Meal prepping routine  
- Regular exercise schedule"
4. USER: "I've started meal prepping and jogging."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "I think it's a good start."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your career advancement and healthier lifestyle?**

For Example:
1. Complete a half marathon in under 2 hours.
2. Prepare 5 healthy meals weekly for 3 months.
3. Jog 20 miles weekly for 6 consecutive weeks."
8. USER: "Get a promotion by year-end."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of getting a promotion already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Secure promotion by December 31st with 10% salary increase.'"
10. USER: "Secure promotion with a 10% raise by year-end."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. USER: "By December 31st."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of securing a promotion with a 10% raise by December 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Securing a 15% raise by December 31st.  
2. Achieving promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st.  
3. Securing promotion and raise by September 30th."
14. USER: "Achieving it by October 31st."
15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "I think this is just right."
17. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to secure a promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Complete a leadership skills course online.  
2. Schedule weekly meetings with your manager for feedback.  
3. Prepare a presentation showcasing your recent achievements."
18. USER: "I'll schedule a feedback meeting."
19. CHATBOT: "Scheduling a feedback meeting is a great step to understand your current standing and areas for improvement. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. USER: "I think it's a great start."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great decision to move forward with. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of scheduling this feedback meeting? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my weekly report on Friday, I will schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.
2. When I receive my monthly performance review email, I'll immediately schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.
3. If I complete my Monday morning team meeting, I will schedule a feedback meeting with my manager."
22. USER: "When I finish my weekly report."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid cue. **Is there a specific day and location where you usually finish your weekly report?** This will help make the cue more concrete and actionable."
24. USER: "I usually finish it on Fridays at my desk."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your promotion. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on scheduling your feedback meeting."
26. USER: "Yes, that would be great!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Secure promotion with a 10% raise by October 31st.

**Action:** Schedule a feedback meeting with my manager.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my weekly report on Fridays at my desk then schedule a feedback meeting with my manager."
