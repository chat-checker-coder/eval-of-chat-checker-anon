    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Hi! I want to balance my academics, activism, and personal life."
3. Chatbot: "Balancing academics, activism, and personal life is a commendable goal and can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to achieve this balance?**

For example:  
- Time-blocking schedule  
- Prioritize tasks weekly  
- Set clear boundaries"
4. User: "I try weekly task lists."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal, or are you considering making adjustments?**"
6. User: "I'm considering making adjustments."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve balance in academics, activism, and personal life. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research time management techniques to effectively allocate time for academics, activism, and personal life.
   
2. Learn about setting priorities and boundaries to ensure a balanced approach to different aspects of life.

3. Explore strategies for self-care and stress management to maintain well-being while juggling multiple responsibilities."
8. User: "I want to explore stress management."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring stress management already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three stress management techniques by June 2, 2025."
10. User: "I'll identify stress techniques by February."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "I'll practice each technique weekly."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'practicing stress management techniques' sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Practicing three techniques daily starting today.
2. Identifying and practicing five techniques weekly by June 2025.
3. Identifying six techniques before choosing three to practice."
14. User: "I'll identify and try six techniques."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself and expand your stress management toolkit! 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This level feels right now."
17. Chatbot: "It's wonderful that you've set a goal to enhance your stress management skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on stress management techniques.  
2. Attend a stress management workshop monthly.  
3. Watch 4 expert talks on stress reduction strategies.  "
18. User: "I'll watch a few talks."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **Do you think watching a specific number of talks each week will help you stay on track with your goal?**"
20. User: "Yes, I'll aim for two talks."
21. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these expert talks? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch on Wednesdays, I will watch an expert talk on stress reduction.
2. When I complete my Friday morning workout, I'll watch an expert talk on stress reduction.
3. If I sit down with my evening tea on Sundays, I will watch an expert talk on stress reduction."
22. User: "When I finish my classes on Thursdays."
23. Chatbot: "Great choice! Finishing your classes on Thursdays is a reliable and noticeable cue. **Do you have a specific location in mind where you'll watch the expert talks after your classes?**"
24. User: "My dorm room, it's quiet there."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards stress management. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your expert talks."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify and practice six stress management techniques weekly by February 2025.

**Action:** Watch two expert talks on stress reduction strategies each week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my classes on Thursdays in my dorm room then watch two expert talks on stress reduction strategies each week."
