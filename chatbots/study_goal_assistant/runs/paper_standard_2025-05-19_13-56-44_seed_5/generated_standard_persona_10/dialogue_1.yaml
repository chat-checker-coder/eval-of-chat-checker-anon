            stress management techniques weekly by February 2025,' which is not what
            the user specified. The user did not mention a specific deadline for identifying
            and practicing the techniques, only that they would watch two talks weekly.
            This constitutes a 'Wrong information' breakdown as the chatbot incorrectly
            summarizes the user's goal timeline. Additionally, the implementation
            intention is slightly misrepresented as it suggests watching two talks
