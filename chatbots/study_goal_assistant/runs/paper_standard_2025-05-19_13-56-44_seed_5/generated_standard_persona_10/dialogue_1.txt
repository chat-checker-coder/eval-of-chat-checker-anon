Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Hi! I want to balance my academics, activism, and personal life."
3. CHATBOT: "Balancing academics, activism, and personal life is a commendable goal and can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to achieve this balance?**

For example:  
- Time-blocking schedule  
- Prioritize tasks weekly  
- Set clear boundaries"
4. USER: "I try weekly task lists."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal, or are you considering making adjustments?**"
6. USER: "I'm considering making adjustments."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve balance in academics, activism, and personal life. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research time management techniques to effectively allocate time for academics, activism, and personal life.
   
2. Learn about setting priorities and boundaries to ensure a balanced approach to different aspects of life.

3. Explore strategies for self-care and stress management to maintain well-being while juggling multiple responsibilities."
8. USER: "I want to explore stress management."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exploring stress management already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three stress management techniques by June 2, 2025."
10. USER: "I'll identify stress techniques by February."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "I'll practice each technique weekly."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'practicing stress management techniques' sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Practicing three techniques daily starting today.
2. Identifying and practicing five techniques weekly by June 2025.
3. Identifying six techniques before choosing three to practice."
14. USER: "I'll identify and try six techniques."
15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself and expand your stress management toolkit! 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This level feels right now."
17. CHATBOT: "It's wonderful that you've set a goal to enhance your stress management skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on stress management techniques.  
2. Attend a stress management workshop monthly.  
3. Watch 4 expert talks on stress reduction strategies.  "
18. USER: "I'll watch a few talks."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great start! **Do you think watching a specific number of talks each week will help you stay on track with your goal?**"
20. USER: "Yes, I'll aim for two talks."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these expert talks? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch on Wednesdays, I will watch an expert talk on stress reduction.
2. When I complete my Friday morning workout, I'll watch an expert talk on stress reduction.
3. If I sit down with my evening tea on Sundays, I will watch an expert talk on stress reduction."
22. USER: "When I finish my classes on Thursdays."
23. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Finishing your classes on Thursdays is a reliable and noticeable cue. **Do you have a specific location in mind where you'll watch the expert talks after your classes?**"
24. USER: "My dorm room, it's quiet there."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards stress management. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your expert talks."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify and practice six stress management techniques weekly by February 2025.
