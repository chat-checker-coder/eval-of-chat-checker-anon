system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to embrace minimalism."
3. Chatbot: "Embracing minimalism is a wonderful goal that can lead to a more intentional and fulfilling life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to start embracing minimalism?**

For example:  
- Declutter one room weekly  
- Follow a minimalist blog  
- Practice mindful purchasing"
4. User: "I thought of decluttering monthly."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid start! **Do you think this strategy of decluttering monthly is a good strategy to achieve your goal of embracing minimalism?**"
6. User: "Yes, it's manageable and realistic."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a realistic strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for embracing minimalism through monthly decluttering?**

For Example:
1. Reduce possessions by 50% in six months.
2. Limit monthly purchases to five essential items.
3. Donate 30 unused items each month."
8. User: "I'll aim to donate monthly."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of donating unused items already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Donate 30 items by May 31st, 2025, 5 PM.'"
10. User: "I'll donate 20 items monthly."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **When exactly each month do you want to donate the 20 items?**"
12. User: "I'll donate by the 15th."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **How will you measure the success of your goal each month?**"
14. User: "I'll track items donated monthly."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of donating unused items sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Donating 20 items by today.
2. Donating 40 items by the 15th.
3. Donating 20 items every two weeks."
16. User: "I'll start with 20 monthly."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Would you like to consider increasing the number of items or frequency in the future, or are you comfortable with this goal for now?**"
18. User: "I'm comfortable for now."
19. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to donate 20 unused items by the 15th of each month. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Sort through closets for unused items.  
2. Create a donation box in your home.  
3. Schedule monthly donation drop-offs.  "
20. User: "I'll sort through closets."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical and effective action to start with. **Do you think sorting through closets will help you identify enough items to donate, or is there another area you might consider as well?**"
22. User: "I'll also look at the garage."
23. Chatbot: "Great idea! The garage often has items that are no longer needed. **Are you ready to proceed with sorting through closets and the garage as your action?**"
24. User: "Absolutely, I'm ready to start."
25. Chatbot: "Sounds good, sorting through closets and the garage can be very rewarding. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will sort through one closet for donations.
2. When I finish my evening walk, I'll spend 10 minutes sorting the garage.
3. After I finish dinner, I will choose 3 items to donate from my closet."
26. User: "After morning coffee, I'll declutter."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to start this after your morning coffee?**"
28. User: "I'll start on Wednesday."
29. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be having your morning coffee on Wednesday?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific location."
30. User: "In my kitchen, like always."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards donating items. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on sorting through your spaces."
32. User: "Yes, that sounds helpful."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Donate 20 unused items by the 15th of each month and track items donated monthly.

**Action:** Sort through closets and garage for unused items to donate.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen on Wednesday, I'll declutter."
34. User: "Thank you! I'm excited to begin."
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
