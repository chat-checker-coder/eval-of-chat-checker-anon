Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to embrace minimalism."
3. CHATBOT: "Embracing minimalism is a wonderful goal that can lead to a more intentional and fulfilling life. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to start embracing minimalism?**

For example:  
- Declutter one room weekly  
- Follow a minimalist blog  
- Practice mindful purchasing"
4. USER: "I thought of decluttering monthly."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid start! **Do you think this strategy of decluttering monthly is a good strategy to achieve your goal of embracing minimalism?**"
6. USER: "Yes, it's manageable and realistic."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a realistic strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for embracing minimalism through monthly decluttering?**

For Example:
1. Reduce possessions by 50% in six months.
2. Limit monthly purchases to five essential items.
3. Donate 30 unused items each month."
8. USER: "I'll aim to donate monthly."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of donating unused items already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Donate 30 items by May 31st, 2025, 5 PM.'"
10. USER: "I'll donate 20 items monthly."
11. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! **When exactly each month do you want to donate the 20 items?**"
12. USER: "I'll donate by the 15th."
13. CHATBOT: "Great! **How will you measure the success of your goal each month?**"
14. USER: "I'll track items donated monthly."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of donating unused items sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Donating 20 items by today.
2. Donating 40 items by the 15th.
3. Donating 20 items every two weeks."
16. USER: "I'll start with 20 monthly."
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Would you like to consider increasing the number of items or frequency in the future, or are you comfortable with this goal for now?**"
18. USER: "I'm comfortable for now."
19. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to donate 20 unused items by the 15th of each month. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Sort through closets for unused items.  
2. Create a donation box in your home.  
3. Schedule monthly donation drop-offs.  "
20. USER: "I'll sort through closets."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a practical and effective action to start with. **Do you think sorting through closets will help you identify enough items to donate, or is there another area you might consider as well?**"
22. USER: "I'll also look at the garage."
23. CHATBOT: "Great idea! The garage often has items that are no longer needed. **Are you ready to proceed with sorting through closets and the garage as your action?**"
24. USER: "Absolutely, I'm ready to start."
25. CHATBOT: "Sounds good, sorting through closets and the garage can be very rewarding. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will sort through one closet for donations.
2. When I finish my evening walk, I'll spend 10 minutes sorting the garage.
3. After I finish dinner, I will choose 3 items to donate from my closet."
26. USER: "After morning coffee, I'll declutter."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to start this after your morning coffee?**"
28. USER: "I'll start on Wednesday."
29. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Where will you be having your morning coffee on Wednesday?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific location."
30. USER: "In my kitchen, like always."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards donating items. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on sorting through your spaces."
32. USER: "Yes, that sounds helpful."
33. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Donate 20 unused items by the 15th of each month and track items donated monthly.

**Action:** Sort through closets and garage for unused items to donate.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the kitchen on Wednesday, I'll declutter."
34. USER: "Thank you! I'm excited to begin."
35. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
