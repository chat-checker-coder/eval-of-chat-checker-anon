system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to nail entrance exams."
3. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal! Excelling in entrance exams can open up so many opportunities for your future. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent study schedule  
- Practice past exam papers  
- Join a study group"
4. User: "I study consistently and practice."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "I think it's a good start."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify the key topics and subjects covered in the entrance exams you are preparing for.
2. Develop effective study techniques and time management strategies to enhance your exam preparation.
3. Practice past entrance exam papers to familiarize yourself with the exam format and question types."
8. User: "Improve my time management skills."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of improving time management skills already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Explore three time management techniques by Friday, 2025-05-23.'"
10. User: "Plan daily study schedule by Sunday."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "I'll track completed study sessions."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'planning a daily study schedule and tracking completed study sessions' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Planning the study schedule today.  
2. Tracking study sessions by Friday.  
3. Increasing difficulty by adding 2 extra study sessions."
14. User: "I can plan it today!"
15. Chatbot: "That's great! Planning your daily study schedule today will definitely make your goal more challenging. **Do you think you could also track your completed study sessions by Friday, or is there another way you could make it even more challenging?**"
16. User: "Yes, I'll track them by Friday."
17. Chatbot: "Fantastic! Planning your study schedule today and tracking your completed sessions by Friday makes your goal more challenging and structured. **Is there any other aspect you think you could enhance, or is this the most challenging version of your goal?**"
18. User: "I think this is challenging enough."
19. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear and challenging goal to plan your study schedule and track your sessions. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Review past exam papers for study focus.  
2. Create a list of key topics to cover.  
3. Set up a study tracking spreadsheet.  "
20. User: "Create a study tracking spreadsheet."
21. Chatbot: "Creating a study tracking spreadsheet is a fantastic action to help you stay organized and monitor your progress. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be better suited to reach your goal?**"
22. User: "I'm going with this action."
23. Chatbot: "Creating a study tracking spreadsheet is a great step towards staying organized and on top of your studies. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will create a study tracking spreadsheet.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll start my study tracking spreadsheet.
3. If I sit at my study desk after dinner, I will make a study tracking spreadsheet."
24. User: "I'll start after dinner."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a cue for you to start creating the study tracking spreadsheet?**"
26. User: "I usually have dinner in the kitchen."
27. Chatbot: "Great! Having dinner in the kitchen can be a reliable cue. **Would you like to set a specific day this week to start creating your study tracking spreadsheet after dinner in the kitchen?**"
28. User: "I'll start it today."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your study schedule. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your tracking spreadsheet."
30. User: "Sure, that sounds helpful."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Plan daily study schedule by today and track completed study sessions by Friday.

32. User: "Thanks for your help!"
