5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "I think it's a good start."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify the key topics and subjects covered in the entrance exams you are preparing for.
2. Develop effective study techniques and time management strategies to enhance your exam preparation.
3. Practice past entrance exam papers to familiarize yourself with the exam format and question types."
8. USER: "Improve my time management skills."

11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"

13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'planning a daily study schedule and tracking completed study sessions' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Planning the study schedule today.  
2. Tracking study sessions by Friday.  
3. Increasing difficulty by adding 2 extra study sessions."
14. USER: "I can plan it today!"
15. CHATBOT: "That's great! Planning your daily study schedule today will definitely make your goal more challenging. **Do you think you could also track your completed study sessions by Friday, or is there another way you could make it even more challenging?**"
16. USER: "Yes, I'll track them by Friday."
17. CHATBOT: "Fantastic! Planning your study schedule today and tracking your completed sessions by Friday makes your goal more challenging and structured. **Is there any other aspect you think you could enhance, or is this the most challenging version of your goal?**"

19. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear and challenging goal to plan your study schedule and track your sessions. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Review past exam papers for study focus.  
2. Create a list of key topics to cover.  
3. Set up a study tracking spreadsheet.  "
20. USER: "Create a study tracking spreadsheet."
21. CHATBOT: "Creating a study tracking spreadsheet is a fantastic action to help you stay organized and monitor your progress. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be better suited to reach your goal?**"
22. USER: "I'm going with this action."
23. CHATBOT: "Creating a study tracking spreadsheet is a great step towards staying organized and on top of your studies. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will create a study tracking spreadsheet.
2. When I close my work laptop at 5 PM, I'll start my study tracking spreadsheet.
3. If I sit at my study desk after dinner, I will make a study tracking spreadsheet."
24. USER: "I'll start after dinner."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a cue for you to start creating the study tracking spreadsheet?**"
26. USER: "I usually have dinner in the kitchen."
27. CHATBOT: "Great! Having dinner in the kitchen can be a reliable cue. **Would you like to set a specific day this week to start creating your study tracking spreadsheet after dinner in the kitchen?**"
28. USER: "I'll start it today."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your study schedule. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your tracking spreadsheet."
30. USER: "Sure, that sounds helpful."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Plan daily study schedule by today and track completed study sessions by Friday.
