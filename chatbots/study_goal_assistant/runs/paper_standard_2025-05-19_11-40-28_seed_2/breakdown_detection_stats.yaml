        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance acknowledges the user's intention
                to join a club, which is relevant to the user's goal of improving
                public speaking skills. However, the follow-up question "Do you think
                this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?" is
                somewhat redundant and lacks clarity. The user has already indicated
                interest in joining a club, and the chatbot should ideally help the
                user refine this strategy or suggest additional steps rather than
                questioning its adequacy. This could lead to a slight dialogue breakdown
                due to lack of clarity and redundancy, as the question doesn't add
                value or guide the user further in the goal-setting process.

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance acknowledges the user's plan
                to start weekly planning sessions and provides positive feedback,
                which is appropriate. However, the follow-up question, "Do you think
                this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?", is
                somewhat redundant. The user has already indicated their plan, and
                the chatbot should ideally help refine or build upon this plan rather
                than question its adequacy. This could lead to a slight breakdown
                in the conversation as it doesn't advance the goal-setting process
                effectively. The chatbot should focus on helping the user develop
                an implementation intention or explore further steps rather than questioning
                the user's strategy at this point.

            do you want to achieve the goal?**
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance suggests that the user's goal
                lacks a specific time frame, even though the user has already specified
                'by Q2', which is a concrete time frame. The chatbot's response indicates
                a misunderstanding of the user's input, leading to a semantic error.
                The user has provided a clear time frame, and the chatbot's request
                for a more specific time is unnecessary and incorrect. This can confuse
                the user and disrupt the flow of the conversation.

            of the goal and action we set together:


            **Goal:** Running 15K by August 20th.


            **Action:** Run 5K three times weekly


            **Implementation Intention:** when I see the sunset at the local park
            on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then I will run 5K three times weekly'
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance provides a summary of the user's
                goal, action, and implementation intention. However, there is a minor
                issue with the phrasing of the implementation intention. The phrase
                "then I will run 5K three times weekly" is slightly awkward because
                it repeats the frequency ("three times weekly") which is already implied
                by the specific days mentioned (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). This
                could be seen as a lack of clarity or redundancy, as the frequency
                is already clear from the context. Despite this, the overall message
                is understandable, and the user can still follow the conversation
                smoothly. Therefore, the breakdown is minor and does not significantly
                hinder the conversation.

            Thursday?** This will help solidify the cue.
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance asks the user about the location
                where they have their morning coffee on Thursday. This question seems
                to be aimed at helping the user solidify the cue for their implementation
                intention. However, the relevance of this question is not clear in
                the context of setting a goal or an action plan. The location of having
                coffee does not directly contribute to the goal-setting process or
                the implementation of the action. This can lead to confusion for the
                user as to why this information is necessary, thus causing a lack
                of clarity in the conversation. Therefore, this utterance leads to
                a dialogue breakdown due to lack of clarity and unclear intention.
