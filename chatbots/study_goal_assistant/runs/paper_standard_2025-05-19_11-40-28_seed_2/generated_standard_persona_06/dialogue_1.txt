Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd like to run a marathon."
3. CHATBOT: "That's great! A marathon is such a huge achievement—both physically and mentally. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured training plan.  
- Join a local running club.  
- Hire a marathon coach."
4. USER: "I'm following a structured plan."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, but I'd love tips."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, you already have the skills to run a marathon and you know how to get there! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now what could be a performance goal for running a marathon?**

For Example:
1. Complete marathon in under 3 hours 30 minutes.
2. Finish marathon without walking breaks.
3. Achieve personal best marathon time."
8. USER: "Finish without walking breaks."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of finishing a marathon without walking breaks already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 5K without walking by June 15th."
10. USER: "Complete 10K continuously by August."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in August do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. USER: "By August 20th."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing a 10K continuously by August 20th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing 10K continuously by June 1st.  
2. Running 15K continuously by August 20th.  
3. Completing 10K continuously by July 1st."
14. USER: "Running 15K by August 20th."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This feels challenging enough!"
17. CHATBOT: "Running a 15K by August 20th is an impressive goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Run 5K three times a week.  
2. Increase distance by 1K each week.  
3. Join a local running club.  "
18. USER: "Run 5K three times weekly."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan to build your endurance! **Do you think this action is the best way to start your training, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. USER: "I'll stick to this plan."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great commitment to your fitness journey! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of running 5K three times weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will lace up my running shoes.
2. When I see the sunset on Tuesday, I will start my 5K run.
3. If I hear my alarm on Saturday morning, I will head out for a 5K run."
22. USER: "When I see the sunset."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a beautiful cue! **On which specific days will you see the sunset and start your 5K run?** This will help ensure consistency in your routine."
24. USER: "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
25. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Where will you be when you see the sunset on these days to ensure you start your 5K run?** This will help solidify your routine."
26. USER: "At the local park."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards running 15K. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your 5K runs."
28. USER: "Sure, that sounds helpful!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Running 15K by August 20th.

**Action:** Run 5K three times weekly

**Implementation Intention:** when I see the sunset at the local park on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then I will run 5K three times weekly"
30. USER: "Thanks for the summary! Looking forward to it."
31. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
