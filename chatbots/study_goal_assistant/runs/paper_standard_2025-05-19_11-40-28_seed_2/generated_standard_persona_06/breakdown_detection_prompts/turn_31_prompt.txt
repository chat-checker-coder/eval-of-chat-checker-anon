system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to run a marathon."
3. Chatbot: "That's great! A marathon is such a huge achievement—both physically and mentally. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured training plan.  
- Join a local running club.  
- Hire a marathon coach."
4. User: "I'm following a structured plan."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but I'd love tips."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, you already have the skills to run a marathon and you know how to get there! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now what could be a performance goal for running a marathon?**

For Example:
1. Complete marathon in under 3 hours 30 minutes.
2. Finish marathon without walking breaks.
3. Achieve personal best marathon time."
8. User: "Finish without walking breaks."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of finishing a marathon without walking breaks already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 5K without walking by June 15th."
10. User: "Complete 10K continuously by August."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in August do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By August 20th."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing a 10K continuously by August 20th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing 10K continuously by June 1st.  
2. Running 15K continuously by August 20th.  
3. Completing 10K continuously by July 1st."
14. User: "Running 15K by August 20th."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This feels challenging enough!"
17. Chatbot: "Running a 15K by August 20th is an impressive goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Run 5K three times a week.  
2. Increase distance by 1K each week.  
3. Join a local running club.  "
18. User: "Run 5K three times weekly."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to build your endurance! **Do you think this action is the best way to start your training, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "I'll stick to this plan."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great commitment to your fitness journey! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of running 5K three times weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will lace up my running shoes.
2. When I see the sunset on Tuesday, I will start my 5K run.
3. If I hear my alarm on Saturday morning, I will head out for a 5K run."
22. User: "When I see the sunset."
23. Chatbot: "That's a beautiful cue! **On which specific days will you see the sunset and start your 5K run?** This will help ensure consistency in your routine."
24. User: "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be when you see the sunset on these days to ensure you start your 5K run?** This will help solidify your routine."
26. User: "At the local park."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards running 15K. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your 5K runs."
28. User: "Sure, that sounds helpful!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Running 15K by August 20th.

**Action:** Run 5K three times weekly

**Implementation Intention:** when I see the sunset at the local park on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then I will run 5K three times weekly"
30. User: "Thanks for the summary! Looking forward to it."
