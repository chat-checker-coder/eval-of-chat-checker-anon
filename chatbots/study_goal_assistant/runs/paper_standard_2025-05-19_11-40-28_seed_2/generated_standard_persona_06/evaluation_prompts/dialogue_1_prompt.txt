system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to run a marathon."
3. Chatbot: "That's great! A marathon is such a huge achievement—both physically and mentally. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured training plan.  
- Join a local running club.  
- Hire a marathon coach."
4. User: "I'm following a structured plan."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but I'd love tips."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, you already have the skills to run a marathon and you know how to get there! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now what could be a performance goal for running a marathon?**

For Example:
1. Complete marathon in under 3 hours 30 minutes.
2. Finish marathon without walking breaks.
3. Achieve personal best marathon time."
8. User: "Finish without walking breaks."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of finishing a marathon without walking breaks already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete 5K without walking by June 15th."
10. User: "Complete 10K continuously by August."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in August do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By August 20th."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing a 10K continuously by August 20th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Completing 10K continuously by June 1st.  
2. Running 15K continuously by August 20th.  
3. Completing 10K continuously by July 1st."
14. User: "Running 15K by August 20th."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great way to push yourself further! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This feels challenging enough!"
17. Chatbot: "Running a 15K by August 20th is an impressive goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Run 5K three times a week.  
2. Increase distance by 1K each week.  
3. Join a local running club.  "
18. User: "Run 5K three times weekly."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan to build your endurance! **Do you think this action is the best way to start your training, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "I'll stick to this plan."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great commitment to your fitness journey! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of running 5K three times weekly? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will lace up my running shoes.
2. When I see the sunset on Tuesday, I will start my 5K run.
3. If I hear my alarm on Saturday morning, I will head out for a 5K run."
22. User: "When I see the sunset."
23. Chatbot: "That's a beautiful cue! **On which specific days will you see the sunset and start your 5K run?** This will help ensure consistency in your routine."
24. User: "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be when you see the sunset on these days to ensure you start your 5K run?** This will help solidify your routine."
26. User: "At the local park."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards running 15K. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your 5K runs."
28. User: "Sure, that sounds helpful!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Running 15K by August 20th.

**Action:** Run 5K three times weekly

**Implementation Intention:** when I see the sunset at the local park on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then I will run 5K three times weekly"
30. User: "Thanks for the summary! Looking forward to it."
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
