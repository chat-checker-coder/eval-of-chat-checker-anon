Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd like to create an effective social media strategy for my business over the next quarter."
3. CHATBOT: "Creating an effective social media strategy sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as increasing brand awareness, boosting customer engagement, or driving sales growth. **Would you still like to keep creating a social media strategy as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "I'd like to drive sales growth."
5. CHATBOT: "Driving sales growth is an exciting and ambitious goal! It can have a significant impact on your business's success. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong customer relationship management  
- Effective digital marketing campaigns  
- Data-driven decision making"
6. USER: "I'm focusing on digital marketing."
7. CHATBOT: "Digital marketing is a powerful strategy to drive sales growth. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. USER: "Yes, it's a solid start."
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for your digital marketing strategy?**

For Example:
1. Increase online sales by 20% in Q1.
2. Boost website traffic by 30% this month.
3. Achieve 15% conversion rate on digital ads."
10. USER: "I aim for a 25% sales increase."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of a '25% sales increase' already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Increase sales by 25% by December 31, 2025.'"
12. USER: "Increase sales by 25% by March 31, 2024."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'increasing sales by 25% by March 31, 2024' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Achieving a 25% sales increase by December 31, 2023.  
2. Increasing sales by 30% by March 31, 2024.  
3. Achieving a 25% increase by February 28, 2024."
14. USER: "I'll aim for 30% by March 2024."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most ambitious yet achievable goal for you?**"
16. USER: "This is the most ambitious goal."
17. CHATBOT: "Increasing sales by 30% by March 31, 2024, is an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Launch a targeted marketing campaign.  
2. Offer limited-time discounts and promotions.  
3. Expand product offerings to new markets."
18. USER: "I'll launch a targeted campaign."
19. CHATBOT: "Launching a targeted marketing campaign sounds like a great action to increase sales. **Do you think this is the best action to reach your goal, or are there other actions you might consider?**"
20. USER: "It's definitely a strong start."
21. CHATBOT: "Launching a targeted marketing campaign is indeed a strong start. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my weekly sales meeting, I will launch a targeted marketing campaign.
2. When I review monthly sales reports, I'll initiate a targeted marketing campaign.
3. If I complete my morning coffee, I will start a targeted marketing campaign."
22. USER: "When I finish my morning coffee."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
24. USER: "I usually have coffee in my office."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! Having your morning coffee in your office is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish my morning coffee in my office, I will launch a targeted marketing campaign"?**"
26. USER: "Yes, let's proceed with that."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards increasing sales. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your marketing campaign."
28. USER: "That sounds great, thank you!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Increase sales by 30% by March 31, 2024.

**Action:** Launch a targeted marketing campaign
