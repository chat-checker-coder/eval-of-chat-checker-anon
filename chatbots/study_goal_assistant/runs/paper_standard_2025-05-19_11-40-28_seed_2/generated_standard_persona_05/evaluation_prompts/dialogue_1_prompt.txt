# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to create an effective social media strategy for my business over the next quarter."
3. Chatbot: "Creating an effective social media strategy sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as increasing brand awareness, boosting customer engagement, or driving sales growth. **Would you still like to keep creating a social media strategy as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I'd like to drive sales growth."
5. Chatbot: "Driving sales growth is an exciting and ambitious goal! It can have a significant impact on your business's success. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong customer relationship management  
- Effective digital marketing campaigns  
- Data-driven decision making"
6. User: "I'm focusing on digital marketing."
7. Chatbot: "Digital marketing is a powerful strategy to drive sales growth. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Yes, it's a solid start."
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for your digital marketing strategy?**

For Example:
1. Increase online sales by 20% in Q1.
2. Boost website traffic by 30% this month.
3. Achieve 15% conversion rate on digital ads."
10. User: "I aim for a 25% sales increase."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of a '25% sales increase' already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Increase sales by 25% by December 31, 2025.'"
12. User: "Increase sales by 25% by March 31, 2024."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of 'increasing sales by 25% by March 31, 2024' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Achieving a 25% sales increase by December 31, 2023.  
2. Increasing sales by 30% by March 31, 2024.  
3. Achieving a 25% increase by February 28, 2024."
14. User: "I'll aim for 30% by March 2024."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most ambitious yet achievable goal for you?**"
16. User: "This is the most ambitious goal."
17. Chatbot: "Increasing sales by 30% by March 31, 2024, is an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Launch a targeted marketing campaign.  
2. Offer limited-time discounts and promotions.  
3. Expand product offerings to new markets."
18. User: "I'll launch a targeted campaign."
19. Chatbot: "Launching a targeted marketing campaign sounds like a great action to increase sales. **Do you think this is the best action to reach your goal, or are there other actions you might consider?**"
20. User: "It's definitely a strong start."
21. Chatbot: "Launching a targeted marketing campaign is indeed a strong start. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my weekly sales meeting, I will launch a targeted marketing campaign.
2. When I review monthly sales reports, I'll initiate a targeted marketing campaign.
3. If I complete my morning coffee, I will start a targeted marketing campaign."
22. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
24. User: "I usually have coffee in my office."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! Having your morning coffee in your office is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish my morning coffee in my office, I will launch a targeted marketing campaign"?**"
26. User: "Yes, let's proceed with that."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards increasing sales. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your marketing campaign."
28. User: "That sounds great, thank you!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Increase sales by 30% by March 31, 2024.

**Action:** Launch a targeted marketing campaign

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in my office, I will launch a targeted marketing campaign"
30. User: "Thank you for your help!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
