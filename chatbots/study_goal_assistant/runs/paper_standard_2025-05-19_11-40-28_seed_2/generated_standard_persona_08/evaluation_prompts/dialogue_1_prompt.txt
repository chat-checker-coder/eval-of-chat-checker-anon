system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm eager to excel in digital marketing."
3. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! Excelling in digital marketing can open up so many opportunities and is a valuable skill in today's world. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong social media presence  
- Advanced analytics skills  
- Content creation expertise"
4. User: "Strengthening my network and analytics skills."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, but could use refining."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of excelling in digital marketing. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and enroll in an online course or certification program to learn the latest digital marketing strategies and tools.
2. Study successful digital marketing campaigns to understand the techniques and approaches that led to their success.
3. Practice using digital marketing platforms, such as Google Ads and social media advertising, to gain hands-on experience and improve your skills."
8. User: "Enroll in a digital marketing course."
9. Chatbot: "Enrolling in a digital marketing course is a great step, but it sounds more like a performance goal. **How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
10. User: "Develop foundational knowledge in key areas."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of developing foundational knowledge in key areas of digital marketing already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Research three digital marketing strategies by Friday, choose one.'"
12. User: "Explore SEO and analytics tools weekly."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **When exactly do you want to start this weekly exploration, and how will you measure your progress?**"
14. User: "I'll start next Monday. I'll track progress by keeping a journal of what I learn."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring SEO and analytics tools sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Starting your exploration today.
2. Exploring two tools daily instead of weekly.
3. Identifying 10 tools before next Monday."
16. User: "Let's go with two tools daily!"
17. Chatbot: "Great choice! Exploring two tools daily will definitely enhance your learning experience. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "This level's perfect for now!"
19. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to explore SEO and analytics tools, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read two SEO tool guides daily.  
2. Watch tutorials on SEO analytics tools.  
3. Join SEO webinars and take notes."
20. User: "I'll read two SEO guides daily."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Do you think reading guides will give you a comprehensive understanding, or would you consider combining it with another action like watching tutorials or joining webinars?**"
22. User: "Combining with tutorials sounds good!"
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great approach to learning! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading two SEO guides and watching tutorials daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read two SEO guides.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll watch SEO tutorials.
3. If I complete my morning coffee, I will explore two SEO tools."
24. User: "I'll start after my lunch break."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you plan to read the SEO guides and watch tutorials after your lunch break?**"
26. User: "Yeah, I'll use my desk."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exploring tools. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading and watching."
28. User: "Sure, that sounds great!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Explore two SEO and analytics tools daily starting next Monday, and track progress by keeping a journal of what I learn.

**Action:** Read two SEO guides and watch tutorials daily.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch break at my desk then read two SEO guides and watch tutorials daily."
30. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
