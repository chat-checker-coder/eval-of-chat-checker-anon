# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm thinking about working part-time."
3. Chatbot: "Working part-time sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as achieving a better work-life balance, gaining new skills, or having more time for personal projects. **Would you still like to keep working part-time as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, let's focus on rejoining."
5. Chatbot: "Rejoining the workforce is an exciting step and can open up many new opportunities for you. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place for how you will approach rejoining the workforce?**

For example:  
- Updated resume and cover letter  
- Networking with industry contacts  
- Skill enhancement through online courses"
6. User: "I don't have a plan yet."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve rejoining the workforce part-time. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research current job market trends and identify industries with part-time opportunities that match your skills and interests.

2. Update your resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect your most recent skills and experiences, and learn how to effectively network online and in-person.

3. Explore and enroll in online courses or workshops to refresh or acquire new skills relevant to the part-time positions you are interested in."
8. User: "I like the resume update idea."
9. Chatbot: "Great choice! Updating your resume is a crucial step in rejoining the workforce. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Learn how to effectively update my resume to highlight my skills and experiences for part-time job opportunities.""
10. User: "I'll learn to tailor my resume."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of tailoring your resume already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Develop three resume versions for part-time jobs by June 2."
12. User: "Create three targeted resumes by July."
13. Chatbot: "**When in July do you want to have these resumes completed?**"
14. User: "I'll aim for mid-July."
15. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the success of your tailored resumes?**"
16. User: "I'll get feedback from peers."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating targeted resumes sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Completing all resumes by today.
2. Getting feedback from peers by this Friday.
3. Increasing the difficulty by tailoring each resume for five different job types."
18. User: "I think I'll stick with it."
19. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating three targeted resumes and getting feedback by mid-July is a great step towards securing part-time jobs. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a resume writing workshop.  
2. Read a book on effective resume writing.  
3. Consult a career coach for personalized advice.  "
20. User: "I'll attend a resume workshop."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive step towards your goal! **Do you think attending the workshop will provide you with the strategies you need to create targeted resumes, or is there another action you might consider?**"
22. User: "I think the workshop will help."
23. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Attending a resume workshop can be incredibly beneficial. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending the workshop? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will attend a resume workshop.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll join a resume workshop.
3. If I see my calendar reminder for lunch, I will attend a resume workshop."
24. User: "When I see my calendar reminder."
25. Chatbot: "It's great that you have a cue in mind! However, the cue should be independent of external reminders like phone alerts. **Could you think of a physical event or location that could serve as a cue for attending the resume workshop?**"
26. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable and noticeable cue! **Do you have a specific day in mind when you plan to finish your morning coffee and attend the resume workshop?**"
28. User: "I'm thinking Monday should work."
29. Chatbot: "Monday sounds like a great choice! **Do you have a specific location where you'll be finishing your morning coffee and then attending the resume workshop?**"
30. User: "I'll be at my kitchen table."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your goal of creating targeted resumes. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on attending the workshop."
32. User: "Sure, that would be helpful."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Create three targeted resumes for part-time jobs and get feedback from peers by mid-July.

**Action:** Attend a resume workshop

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at my kitchen table on Monday then attend a resume workshop"
34. User: "Thanks for your help!"
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
