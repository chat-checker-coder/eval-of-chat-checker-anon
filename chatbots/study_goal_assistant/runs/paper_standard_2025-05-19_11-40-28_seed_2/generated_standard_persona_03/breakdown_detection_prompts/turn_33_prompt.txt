system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm thinking about working part-time."
3. Chatbot: "Working part-time sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as achieving a better work-life balance, gaining new skills, or having more time for personal projects. **Would you still like to keep working part-time as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, let's focus on rejoining."
5. Chatbot: "Rejoining the workforce is an exciting step and can open up many new opportunities for you. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place for how you will approach rejoining the workforce?**

For example:  
- Updated resume and cover letter  
- Networking with industry contacts  
- Skill enhancement through online courses"
6. User: "I don't have a plan yet."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve rejoining the workforce part-time. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research current job market trends and identify industries with part-time opportunities that match your skills and interests.

2. Update your resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect your most recent skills and experiences, and learn how to effectively network online and in-person.

3. Explore and enroll in online courses or workshops to refresh or acquire new skills relevant to the part-time positions you are interested in."
8. User: "I like the resume update idea."
9. Chatbot: "Great choice! Updating your resume is a crucial step in rejoining the workforce. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, "Learn how to effectively update my resume to highlight my skills and experiences for part-time job opportunities.""
10. User: "I'll learn to tailor my resume."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of tailoring your resume already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Develop three resume versions for part-time jobs by June 2."
12. User: "Create three targeted resumes by July."
13. Chatbot: "**When in July do you want to have these resumes completed?**"
14. User: "I'll aim for mid-July."
15. Chatbot: "**How will you measure the success of your tailored resumes?**"
16. User: "I'll get feedback from peers."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating targeted resumes sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Completing all resumes by today.
2. Getting feedback from peers by this Friday.
3. Increasing the difficulty by tailoring each resume for five different job types."
18. User: "I think I'll stick with it."
19. Chatbot: "Your goal of creating three targeted resumes and getting feedback by mid-July is a great step towards securing part-time jobs. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a resume writing workshop.  
2. Read a book on effective resume writing.  
3. Consult a career coach for personalized advice.  "
20. User: "I'll attend a resume workshop."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive step towards your goal! **Do you think attending the workshop will provide you with the strategies you need to create targeted resumes, or is there another action you might consider?**"
22. User: "I think the workshop will help."
23. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Attending a resume workshop can be incredibly beneficial. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending the workshop? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will attend a resume workshop.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll join a resume workshop.
3. If I see my calendar reminder for lunch, I will attend a resume workshop."
24. User: "When I see my calendar reminder."
25. Chatbot: "It's great that you have a cue in mind! However, the cue should be independent of external reminders like phone alerts. **Could you think of a physical event or location that could serve as a cue for attending the resume workshop?**"
26. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable and noticeable cue! **Do you have a specific day in mind when you plan to finish your morning coffee and attend the resume workshop?**"
28. User: "I'm thinking Monday should work."
29. Chatbot: "Monday sounds like a great choice! **Do you have a specific location where you'll be finishing your morning coffee and then attending the resume workshop?**"
30. User: "I'll be at my kitchen table."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your goal of creating targeted resumes. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on attending the workshop."
32. User: "Sure, that would be helpful."
