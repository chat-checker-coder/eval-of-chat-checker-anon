            there were a few instances where the chatbot asked for additional specificity
            or challenge, which could have been streamlined. The conversation had
            a few unnecessary turns, such as asking for a specific location for drinking
            coffee, which slightly reduced efficiency.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and aligned with its purpose.
            It avoided providing medical or harmful advice and redirected the user
            towards setting a goal. The chatbot maintained a professional tone throughout
            the conversation, but some questions about specific locations for drinking
            coffee felt slightly unnecessary.
        rating: 4
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was mostly natural and conversational, but
            there were moments where the phrasing was slightly robotic or overly formal,
            such as repeatedly asking for more specificity or challenge. The conversation
            could have felt more fluid with less rigid questioning.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It achieved the task of helping the user set
            a specific goal and an implementation intention. However, there were minor
            inefficiencies and slightly unnatural phrasing that prevented a perfect
            score.
