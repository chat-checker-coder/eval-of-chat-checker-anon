# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to start a mentorship program for young professionals."
3. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful initiative! Starting a mentorship program for young professionals can have a significant impact on their careers and personal growth. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Established network of mentors  
- Experience in program management  
- Access to educational resources"
4. User: "I have an extensive network and program management experience."
5. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It’s a solid starting point."
7. Chatbot: "That's good to know you have a solid starting point with your skills and experience! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for starting a mentorship program for young professionals?**

For Example:
1. Enroll 50 young professionals in mentorship program.
2. Match 30 mentors with mentees by year-end.
3. Achieve 90% satisfaction rate from program participants."
8. User: "Enroll 50 participants in 6 months."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of enrolling participants already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Enroll 50 participants by November 19, 2025.'"
10. User: "Enroll 50 participants by April 20, 2024."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of enrolling participants sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Enrolling 50 participants by June 20, 2024.
2. Enrolling 75 participants by April 20, 2024.
3. Enrolling 50 participants by March 20, 2024."
12. User: "Enrolling 50 participants by March 20, 2024."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
14. User: "This is the most challenging."
15. Chatbot: "Enrolling 50 participants by March 20, 2024, is an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Host a networking event for potential participants.  
2. Partner with local universities for outreach.  
3. Launch a social media campaign targeting young professionals."
16. User: "Partner with local universities for outreach."
17. Chatbot: "Partnering with local universities for outreach is a great strategy to reach potential participants. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to explore other options as well?**"
18. User: "I'll proceed with this action."
19. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic decision to partner with local universities for outreach. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will contact a university for outreach.
2. When I log into my work email, I'll schedule a meeting with a university representative.
3. If I complete my lunch break, I will draft an outreach proposal for a university."
20. User: "When I finish my morning coffee, I'll contact a university for outreach."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific day this week when you plan to finish your morning coffee and contact a university for outreach?**"
22. User: "I’ll do it on Thursday."
23. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee on Thursday?** This will help solidify the cue."
24. User: "I have it at home."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enrolling participants. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your university partnerships."
26. User: "I'd appreciate that. Thank you!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Enroll 50 participants by March 20, 2024.

**Action:** Partner with local universities for outreach.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at home on Thursday, I'll contact a university for outreach."
28. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
