**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"

6. USER: "It’s a solid starting point."
7. CHATBOT: "That's good to know you have a solid starting point with your skills and experience! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for starting a mentorship program for young professionals?**

'Enroll 50 participants by November 19, 2025.'"
10. USER: "Enroll 50 participants by April 20, 2024."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of enrolling participants sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

1. Enrolling 50 participants by June 20, 2024.
2. Enrolling 75 participants by April 20, 2024.
3. Enrolling 50 participants by March 20, 2024."

14. USER: "This is the most challenging."
15. CHATBOT: "Enrolling 50 participants by March 20, 2024, is an ambitious and exciting goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Host a networking event for potential participants.  
2. Partner with local universities for outreach.  
3. Launch a social media campaign targeting young professionals."
16. USER: "Partner with local universities for outreach."
17. CHATBOT: "Partnering with local universities for outreach is a great strategy to reach potential participants. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to explore other options as well?**"
18. USER: "I'll proceed with this action."
19. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic decision to partner with local universities for outreach. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will contact a university for outreach.
2. When I log into my work email, I'll schedule a meeting with a university representative.
3. If I complete my lunch break, I will draft an outreach proposal for a university."

22. USER: "I’ll do it on Thursday."
23. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee on Thursday?** This will help solidify the cue."
24. USER: "I have it at home."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards enrolling participants. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your university partnerships."
26. USER: "I'd appreciate that. Thank you!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Enroll 50 participants by March 20, 2024.
