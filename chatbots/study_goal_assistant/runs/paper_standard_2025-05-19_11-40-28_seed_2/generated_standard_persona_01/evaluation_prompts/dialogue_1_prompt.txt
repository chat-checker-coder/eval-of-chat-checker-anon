system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to improve my public speaking skills over the next three months."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your public speaking skills is a fantastic goal! It can open up so many opportunities and boost your confidence in various aspects of life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Join a public speaking club  
- Practice with a speaking coach  
- Record and review speeches"
4. User: "I've thought about joining a club."
5. Chatbot: "Joining a club is a great start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, it seems promising."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a promising strategy! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for improving your public speaking skills?**

For Example:
1. Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently.
2. Receive positive feedback from 3 club members.
3. Reduce filler words by 50% in speeches."
8. User: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of delivering a 5-minute speech confidently already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently by June 1st.'"
10. User: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently by June 10th."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of delivering a 5-minute speech confidently sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Delivering a 5-minute speech confidently by May 20th.  
2. Delivering a 10-minute speech confidently by June 10th.  
3. Delivering a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th."
12. User: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. User: "I think this is challenging enough."
15. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a goal to deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Practice speech daily in front of a mirror.  
2. Record and review speeches for self-feedback.  
3. Join a local Toastmasters club for practice."
16. User: "Join a local Toastmasters club."
17. Chatbot: "Joining a local Toastmasters club is a great way to practice public speaking and gain confidence. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
18. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
19. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic decision! Joining a Toastmasters club can really enhance your public speaking skills. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining the club? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If it's Monday evening, I will attend the local Toastmasters meeting.
2. When I finish dinner on Wednesdays, I will practice my speech at Toastmasters.
3. If I see my calendar reminder for Thursday, I will prepare for Toastmasters."
20. User: "When I see my Monday calendar reminder, I’ll attend Toastmasters."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great start! However, the cue should be independent of external reminders like phone alerts. **Could you think of a physical location or event that happens regularly on Mondays that could serve as a cue?**"
22. User: "When I return home from work, I'll head to Toastmasters."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! Returning home from work is a consistent event that can effectively remind you to attend Toastmasters. **Are you satisfied with this cue, or would you like to refine it further?**"
24. User: "I'm satisfied with this cue."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards delivering confidently. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on joining Toastmasters."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds helpful!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th.

**Action:** Join a local Toastmasters club

**Implementation Intention:** when I return home from work, I'll head to Toastmasters."
28. User: "Thanks! I'm excited to start!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
