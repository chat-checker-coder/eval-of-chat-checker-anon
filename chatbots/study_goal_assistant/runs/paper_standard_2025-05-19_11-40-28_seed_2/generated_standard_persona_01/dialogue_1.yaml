            and lacks clarity. The user has already indicated interest in joining
            a club, and the chatbot should ideally help the user refine this strategy
            or suggest additional steps rather than questioning its adequacy. This
            could lead to a slight dialogue breakdown due to lack of clarity and redundancy,
            as the question doesn't add value or guide the user further in the goal-setting
