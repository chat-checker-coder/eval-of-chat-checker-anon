Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to improve my public speaking skills over the next three months."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving your public speaking skills is a fantastic goal! It can open up so many opportunities and boost your confidence in various aspects of life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Join a public speaking club  
- Practice with a speaking coach  
- Record and review speeches"
4. USER: "I've thought about joining a club."
5. CHATBOT: "Joining a club is a great start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, it seems promising."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a promising strategy! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for improving your public speaking skills?**

For Example:
1. Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently.
2. Receive positive feedback from 3 club members.
3. Reduce filler words by 50% in speeches."
8. USER: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of delivering a 5-minute speech confidently already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently by June 1st.'"
10. USER: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently by June 10th."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of delivering a 5-minute speech confidently sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Delivering a 5-minute speech confidently by May 20th.  
2. Delivering a 10-minute speech confidently by June 10th.  
3. Delivering a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th."
12. USER: "Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th."
13. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. USER: "I think this is challenging enough."
15. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a goal to deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Practice speech daily in front of a mirror.  
2. Record and review speeches for self-feedback.  
3. Join a local Toastmasters club for practice."
16. USER: "Join a local Toastmasters club."
17. CHATBOT: "Joining a local Toastmasters club is a great way to practice public speaking and gain confidence. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
18. USER: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
19. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic decision! Joining a Toastmasters club can really enhance your public speaking skills. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining the club? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If it's Monday evening, I will attend the local Toastmasters meeting.
2. When I finish dinner on Wednesdays, I will practice my speech at Toastmasters.
3. If I see my calendar reminder for Thursday, I will prepare for Toastmasters."
20. USER: "When I see my Monday calendar reminder, I’ll attend Toastmasters."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! However, the cue should be independent of external reminders like phone alerts. **Could you think of a physical location or event that happens regularly on Mondays that could serve as a cue?**"
22. USER: "When I return home from work, I'll head to Toastmasters."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! Returning home from work is a consistent event that can effectively remind you to attend Toastmasters. **Are you satisfied with this cue, or would you like to refine it further?**"
24. USER: "I'm satisfied with this cue."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards delivering confidently. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on joining Toastmasters."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds helpful!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Deliver a 5-minute speech confidently without notes by June 10th.

**Action:** Join a local Toastmasters club

**Implementation Intention:** when I return home from work, I'll head to Toastmasters."
28. USER: "Thanks! I'm excited to start!"
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
