system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd like to create a curriculum that blends art into elementary lessons."
3. Chatbot: "That sounds like a wonderful and creative goal! Integrating art into elementary lessons can make learning more engaging and enjoyable for students. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind for how to create this curriculum?**

For example:  
- Experienced art educator  
- Access to art resources  
- Collaboration with art teachers"
4. User: "I'd love to collaborate!"
5. Chatbot: "Collaboration sounds like a great approach! **Do you think this strategy of collaboration is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, it's a fantastic start!"
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for blending art into elementary lessons?**

For Example:
1. Integrate art in 80% of math lessons.
2. Achieve 90% student engagement in art-infused lessons.
3. Collaborate with 5 art teachers for curriculum development."
8. User: "Achieve 90% student engagement."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of achieving 90% student engagement already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Achieve 90% student engagement by December 15, 2025."
10. User: "Achieve 90% engagement by June."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in June do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By June 20th, 2025."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of achieving 90% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025 sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Achieving 90% engagement by May 25th, 2025.
2. Reaching 95% engagement by June 20th, 2025.
3. Implementing art-infused lessons in all subjects by June 20th, 2025."
14. User: "Reaching 95% by June 20th."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This feels just right for me."
17. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to achieve 95% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Integrate art projects into math and science lessons.  
2. Host weekly art workshops for teachers.  
3. Collaborate with local artists for classroom sessions.  "
18. User: "Hosting weekly art workshops!"
19. Chatbot: "Hosting weekly art workshops sounds like a great way to engage students and teachers alike. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or would you like to consider other actions as well?**"
20. User: "It's definitely the best start!"
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fantastic initiative! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of hosting weekly art workshops? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will plan this week's art workshop.
2. When I close my laptop at the end of the workday, I'll prepare art workshop materials.
3. If I see my art supplies on the shelf, I'll schedule the next workshop session."
22. User: "When I finish morning teaching, I'll plan."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day and location where you finish your morning teaching that you can use as a cue?**"
24. User: "Every Monday in my classroom."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards boosting engagement. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workshops."
26. User: "Yes, that sounds great!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve 95% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025.

**Action:** Hosting weekly art workshops

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish morning teaching every Monday in my classroom, I'll plan hosting weekly art workshops"
28. User: "Thanks so much for your guidance!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
