1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd like to create a curriculum that blends art into elementary lessons."
3. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a wonderful and creative goal! Integrating art into elementary lessons can make learning more engaging and enjoyable for students. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind for how to create this curriculum?**

For example:  
- Experienced art educator  
- Access to art resources  
- Collaboration with art teachers"
4. USER: "I'd love to collaborate!"
5. CHATBOT: "Collaboration sounds like a great approach! **Do you think this strategy of collaboration is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, it's a fantastic start!"
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for blending art into elementary lessons?**

For Example:
1. Integrate art in 80% of math lessons.
2. Achieve 90% student engagement in art-infused lessons.
3. Collaborate with 5 art teachers for curriculum development."
8. USER: "Achieve 90% student engagement."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of achieving 90% student engagement already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Achieve 90% student engagement by December 15, 2025."
10. USER: "Achieve 90% engagement by June."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in June do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. USER: "By June 20th, 2025."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of achieving 90% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025 sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Achieving 90% engagement by May 25th, 2025.
2. Reaching 95% engagement by June 20th, 2025.
3. Implementing art-infused lessons in all subjects by June 20th, 2025."
14. USER: "Reaching 95% by June 20th."
15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This feels just right for me."
17. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to achieve 95% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Integrate art projects into math and science lessons.  
2. Host weekly art workshops for teachers.  
3. Collaborate with local artists for classroom sessions.  "
18. USER: "Hosting weekly art workshops!"
19. CHATBOT: "Hosting weekly art workshops sounds like a great way to engage students and teachers alike. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or would you like to consider other actions as well?**"
20. USER: "It's definitely the best start!"
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a fantastic initiative! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of hosting weekly art workshops? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will plan this week's art workshop.
2. When I close my laptop at the end of the workday, I'll prepare art workshop materials.
3. If I see my art supplies on the shelf, I'll schedule the next workshop session."
22. USER: "When I finish morning teaching, I'll plan."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day and location where you finish your morning teaching that you can use as a cue?**"
24. USER: "Every Monday in my classroom."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards boosting engagement. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workshops."
26. USER: "Yes, that sounds great!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve 95% student engagement in art-infused lessons by June 20th, 2025.

**Action:** Hosting weekly art workshops

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish morning teaching every Monday in my classroom, I'll plan hosting weekly art workshops"
