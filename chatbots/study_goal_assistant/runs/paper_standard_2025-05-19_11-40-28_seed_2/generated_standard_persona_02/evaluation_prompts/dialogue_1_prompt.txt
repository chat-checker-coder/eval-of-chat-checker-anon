system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to enhance team productivity."
3. Chatbot: "Enhancing team productivity is a fantastic goal! It can lead to more efficient workflows and a more harmonious work environment. 

**Do you already have a strategy or procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Clear communication channels  
- Defined roles and responsibilities  
- Regular feedback sessions"
4. User: "I plan to start weekly planning sessions."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach to keep everyone aligned and focused. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, planning sessions should help."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for enhancing team productivity?**

For Example:
1. Increase project completion rate by 20% in Q1.
2. Reduce meeting duration by 30% within two months.
3. Achieve 95% task completion rate weekly."
8. User: "Increase task completion rate by 15%."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of increasing task completion rate already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Increase task completion rate by 15% by July 31st.'"
10. User: "Increase task completion by 15% by Q2."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
12. User: "By June 30th, 2024."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of increasing the task completion rate sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:
1. Achieving a 20% increase by June 30th, 2024.
2. Reaching a 15% increase by March 31st, 2024.
3. Increasing the rate by 15% by December 31st, 2023."
14. User: "I'll aim for 20% by June 30th, 2024."
15. Chatbot: "That's a great and ambitious goal! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This is the right level."
17. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear and achievable goal to increase your task completion rate by 20% by June 30th, 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Implement weekly progress tracking meetings.  
2. Provide task management training sessions.  
3. Introduce productivity-enhancing software tools.  "
18. User: "Implement weekly progress tracking meetings."
19. Chatbot: "Implementing weekly progress tracking meetings is a great way to keep everyone accountable and on track. **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or are there other actions you might consider?**"
20. User: "I'll start with tracking meetings."
21. Chatbot: "Implementing weekly progress tracking meetings is a great step towards maintaining accountability and ensuring progress. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of these meetings? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Monday morning coffee, I will schedule a weekly progress meeting.
2. When I log into my work computer on Monday, I'll set up a progress tracking session.
3. If I complete my Monday morning team check-in, I will organize a weekly review meeting."
22. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could serve as a consistent reminder for you?**"
24. User: "I usually have my coffee at my desk."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! Having your coffee at your desk is a consistent and reliable location. **Would you like to proceed with this cue: "When I finish my morning coffee at my desk, I will implement weekly progress tracking meetings"?**"
26. User: "Yes, let's proceed with that."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards increasing your task completion. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your weekly meetings."
28. User: "Sounds good, let's do that."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Increase task completion rate by 20% by June 30th, 2024.

**Action:** Implement weekly progress tracking meetings

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee at my desk then implement weekly progress tracking meetings"
30. User: "Thank you. Looking forward to it."
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
