        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is a clear and friendly introduction
            to its purpose and capabilities. It invites the user to engage by asking
            about their goal, which is relevant to the task of goal setting. The chatbot
            also encourages the user to ask questions if needed, which is a good practice
            for ensuring clarity and understanding. There are no grammatical errors,
            semantic errors, or any other issues that would lead to a breakdown. The

            The chatbot also asks a follow-up question to engage the user further
            in the goal-setting process. This aligns well with the chatbot's purpose
            of guiding the user in formulating a specific goal and action steps. There

        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance acknowledges the user's plan to

            The user has already indicated their plan, and the chatbot should ideally
            help refine or build upon this plan rather than question its adequacy.
            This could lead to a slight breakdown in the conversation as it doesn't
            advance the goal-setting process effectively. The chatbot should focus
            on helping the user develop an implementation intention or explore further
            steps rather than questioning the user's strategy at this point.
