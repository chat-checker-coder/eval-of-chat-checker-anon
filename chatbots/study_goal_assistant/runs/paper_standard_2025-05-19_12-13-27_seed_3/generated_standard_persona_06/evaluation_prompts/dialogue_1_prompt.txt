system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm aiming to increase physical endurance."
3. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal! Increasing physical endurance can have a significant impact on your overall health and fitness. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent cardio workouts  
- Balanced nutrition plan  
- Regular strength training"
4. User: "I just started advanced workouts."
5. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Advanced workouts can be very effective. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of increasing physical endurance?**"
6. User: "I think it's promising."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a promising strategy with advanced workouts! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for increasing your physical endurance?**

For Example:
1. Complete a half marathon in under 2 hours.
2. Cycle 100 miles in one day.
3. Swim 2 miles without stopping."
8. User: "Run a 10k in 50 minutes."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of running a 10k already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Run a 10k in 50 minutes by June 30th."
10. User: "Run a 10k in 50 minutes by May 30th."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of running a 10k in 50 minutes by May 30th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Running a 10k in 50 minutes today.  
2. Completing the 10k in 45 minutes by May 30th.  
3. Running a 10k in 50 minutes by May 25th."
12. User: "I'll stick to May 30th."
13. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to aim for a faster time, like 48 minutes, or do you prefer to keep it at 50 minutes?**"
14. User: "I'll aim for 48 minutes."
15. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is 48 minutes your final goal?**"
16. User: "48 minutes is my final goal."
17. Chatbot: "That's an impressive goal to run a 10k in 48 minutes by May 30th! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Follow a structured 10k training plan.  
2. Incorporate interval training twice a week.  
3. Run long distances every weekend.  "
18. User: "Incorporate interval training twice a week."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to improve your speed and endurance! **Do you want to continue with this action, or would you like to explore other options?**"
20. User: "I'll stick with intervals."
21. Chatbot: "Incorporating interval training twice a week is a fantastic way to boost your fitness! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Monday workday, I will do interval training at the park.
2. When I complete my Wednesday morning coffee, I'll head out for interval sprints.
3. After I finish my Saturday breakfast, I'll incorporate interval training into my run."
22. User: "When I finish work on Tuesdays, I'll do intervals."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is the location where you'll do the intervals a physical place, like a park or gym?**"
24. User: "Yes, at the local park."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your 10k goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your interval training."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Run a 10k in 48 minutes by May 30th.

**Action:** Incorporate interval training twice a week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish work on Tuesdays at the local park, I'll do intervals."
28. User: "Thanks for your help!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
