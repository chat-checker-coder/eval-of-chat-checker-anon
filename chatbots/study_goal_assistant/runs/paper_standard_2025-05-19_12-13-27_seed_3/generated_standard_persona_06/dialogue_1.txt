Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm aiming to increase physical endurance."
3. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic goal! Increasing physical endurance can have a significant impact on your overall health and fitness. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Consistent cardio workouts  
- Balanced nutrition plan  
- Regular strength training"
4. USER: "I just started advanced workouts."
5. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! Advanced workouts can be very effective. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of increasing physical endurance?**"
6. USER: "I think it's promising."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a promising strategy with advanced workouts! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for increasing your physical endurance?**

For Example:
1. Complete a half marathon in under 2 hours.
2. Cycle 100 miles in one day.
3. Swim 2 miles without stopping."
8. USER: "Run a 10k in 50 minutes."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of running a 10k already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Run a 10k in 50 minutes by June 30th."
10. USER: "Run a 10k in 50 minutes by May 30th."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of running a 10k in 50 minutes by May 30th sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Running a 10k in 50 minutes today.  
2. Completing the 10k in 45 minutes by May 30th.  
3. Running a 10k in 50 minutes by May 25th."
12. USER: "I'll stick to May 30th."
13. CHATBOT: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to aim for a faster time, like 48 minutes, or do you prefer to keep it at 50 minutes?**"
14. USER: "I'll aim for 48 minutes."
15. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is 48 minutes your final goal?**"
16. USER: "48 minutes is my final goal."
17. CHATBOT: "That's an impressive goal to run a 10k in 48 minutes by May 30th! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Follow a structured 10k training plan.  
2. Incorporate interval training twice a week.  
3. Run long distances every weekend.  "
18. USER: "Incorporate interval training twice a week."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great action to improve your speed and endurance! **Do you want to continue with this action, or would you like to explore other options?**"
20. USER: "I'll stick with intervals."
21. CHATBOT: "Incorporating interval training twice a week is a fantastic way to boost your fitness! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Monday workday, I will do interval training at the park.
2. When I complete my Wednesday morning coffee, I'll head out for interval sprints.
3. After I finish my Saturday breakfast, I'll incorporate interval training into my run."
22. USER: "When I finish work on Tuesdays, I'll do intervals."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is the location where you'll do the intervals a physical place, like a park or gym?**"
24. USER: "Yes, at the local park."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your 10k goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your interval training."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Run a 10k in 48 minutes by May 30th.

**Action:** Incorporate interval training twice a week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish work on Tuesdays at the local park, I'll do intervals."
28. USER: "Thanks for your help!"
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
