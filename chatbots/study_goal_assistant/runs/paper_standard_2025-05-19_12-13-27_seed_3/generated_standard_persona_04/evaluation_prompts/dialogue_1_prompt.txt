    intention ("if-then plan").

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm aiming for a strategic role."
3. Chatbot: "That's an exciting ambition! A strategic role can really allow you to make a significant impact within an organization. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders  
- Pursuing relevant certifications  
- Gaining cross-functional experience"
4. User: "I've been networking consistently."
5. Chatbot: "Networking is a great strategy to build connections and open up opportunities. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "I think it's a good start."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for your strategic role ambition?**

For Example:
1. Secure 3 strategic partnerships this quarter.
2. Attend 5 industry networking events monthly.
3. Connect with 10 key industry leaders by year-end."
8. User: "I'll aim to connect with 10 key industry leaders by year-end."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of connecting with industry leaders already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Connect with 10 industry leaders by December 31, 2025."
10. User: "Connect with 10 leaders by December 31, 2025."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of connecting with leaders sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Connecting with 10 leaders by September 30, 2025.  
2. Reaching out to 5 leaders by June 30, 2025.  
3. Or increasing the difficulty by connecting with 15 leaders."
12. User: "I'll connect with 15 leaders."
13. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. User: "This feels like the right level."
15. Chatbot: "Connecting with 15 leaders by December 31, 2025, is an inspiring goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend industry conferences and networking events.  
2. Join professional leadership groups on LinkedIn.  
3. Schedule informational interviews with industry leaders."
16. User: "Join professional leadership groups on LinkedIn."
17. Chatbot: "Joining professional leadership groups on LinkedIn is a great step to connect with leaders. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or would you like to consider other actions as well?**"
18. User: "I'm good with this action."
19. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining professional leadership groups on LinkedIn? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will join a leadership group on LinkedIn.
2. When I log into LinkedIn after lunch, I'll join a professional leadership group.
3. If I complete my work tasks by 5 PM, I'll join a leadership group on LinkedIn."
20. User: "When I log into LinkedIn after lunch."
21. Chatbot: "That's a good cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
22. User: "I usually have lunch at my desk."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having lunch at your desk is a reliable environment. **Would you like to proceed with this cue: "When I log into LinkedIn after lunch at my desk, I'll join professional leadership groups on LinkedIn"?**"
24. User: "Yes, I'll proceed with this."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards connecting with leaders. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on joining those groups."
26. User: "Yes, that would be great."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Connect with 15 leaders by December 31, 2025.

**Action:** Join professional leadership groups on LinkedIn

**Implementation Intention:** when I log into LinkedIn after lunch at my desk then Join professional leadership groups on LinkedIn"
28. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
