system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to improve time management."
3. Chatbot: "Improving time management sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing productivity, achieving work-life balance, or reducing stress. **Would you still like to keep improving time management as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Let's aim for better productivity!"
5. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal! Better productivity can lead to more efficient work and a more balanced life. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time-blocking schedule  
- Prioritized task list  
- Pomodoro technique"
6. User: "I use a prioritized task list."
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach to managing tasks and staying organized. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of better productivity?**"
8. User: "It helps, but I need more."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve better productivity. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement time management techniques to optimize daily tasks and increase efficiency.
2. Learn and practice methods for minimizing distractions and maintaining focus during work sessions.
3. Explore and adopt productivity tools or software that can help streamline workflow and task organization."
10. User: "Learn to minimize distractions."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning to minimize distractions already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three distraction-minimizing strategies by Friday, 2025-05-23."
12. User: "Identify three strategies by May 23."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three distraction-minimizing strategies by May 23 sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Identifying three strategies by today.
2. Identifying three strategies by tomorrow.
3. Identifying five strategies by May 23."
14. User: "Identify five strategies by May 23."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself further! 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This is the right level!"
17. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify five strategies by May 23. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on productivity techniques.  
2. Watch TED Talks on minimizing distractions.  
3. Interview productivity experts for insights.  "
18. User: "I'll read articles this week."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive action to start with! **Do you want to proceed with reading articles as your first action to achieve your goal?**"
20. User: "Yes, let's go with that."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great choice to boost your productivity! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading articles on productivity techniques this week? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read an article on productivity.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll read a productivity article.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read a productivity article."
22. User: "When I have my morning coffee."
23. Chatbot: "That's a great cue! Having your morning coffee is a consistent and noticeable event. **Do you have a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help make your implementation intention even more concrete."
24. User: "I usually have it at home."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
26. User: "Sure, that sounds good!"
