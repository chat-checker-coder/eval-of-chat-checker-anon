Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to improve time management."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving time management sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing productivity, achieving work-life balance, or reducing stress. **Would you still like to keep improving time management as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Let's aim for better productivity!"
5. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic goal! Better productivity can lead to more efficient work and a more balanced life. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Time-blocking schedule  
- Prioritized task list  
- Pomodoro technique"
6. USER: "I use a prioritized task list."
7. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid approach to managing tasks and staying organized. 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of better productivity?**"
8. USER: "It helps, but I need more."
9. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve better productivity. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement time management techniques to optimize daily tasks and increase efficiency.
2. Learn and practice methods for minimizing distractions and maintaining focus during work sessions.
3. Explore and adopt productivity tools or software that can help streamline workflow and task organization."
10. USER: "Learn to minimize distractions."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning to minimize distractions already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three distraction-minimizing strategies by Friday, 2025-05-23."
12. USER: "Identify three strategies by May 23."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying three distraction-minimizing strategies by May 23 sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:
1. Identifying three strategies by today.
2. Identifying three strategies by tomorrow.
3. Identifying five strategies by May 23."
14. USER: "Identify five strategies by May 23."
15. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to challenge yourself further! 

**Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This is the right level!"
17. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify five strategies by May 23. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on productivity techniques.  
2. Watch TED Talks on minimizing distractions.  
3. Interview productivity experts for insights.  "
18. USER: "I'll read articles this week."
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a productive action to start with! **Do you want to proceed with reading articles as your first action to achieve your goal?**"
20. USER: "Yes, let's go with that."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice to boost your productivity! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading articles on productivity techniques this week? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read an article on productivity.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll read a productivity article.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read a productivity article."
22. USER: "When I have my morning coffee."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a great cue! Having your morning coffee is a consistent and noticeable event. **Do you have a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help make your implementation intention even more concrete."
24. USER: "I usually have it at home."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
26. USER: "Sure, that sounds good!"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify five strategies by May 23.

**Action:** Read articles on productivity techniques this week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I have my morning coffee at home then read articles on productivity techniques this week."
28. USER: "Thanks for your help! Looking forward."
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
