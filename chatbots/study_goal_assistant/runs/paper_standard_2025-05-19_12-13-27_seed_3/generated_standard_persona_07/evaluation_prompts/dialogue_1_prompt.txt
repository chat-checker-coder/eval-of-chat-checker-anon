# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to enhance community engagement skills."
3. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful goal! Enhancing community engagement skills can have a significant impact on both your personal growth and the community you are involved with. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend local community events  
- Volunteer for community projects  
- Join community-focused groups"
4. User: "I have some ideas, yes."
5. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It's a good start, yes."
7. Chatbot: "That's good to hear, and it means you should set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for enhancing your community engagement skills?**

For Example:
1. Host 3 community events by year-end.
2. Increase social media engagement by 20% in 6 months.
3. Build 5 new community partnerships by next quarter."
8. User: "Host a monthly community workshop."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of hosting a monthly community workshop already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Host a community workshop on the first Saturday monthly."
10. User: "Host a workshop on nonprofit skills."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great idea! **When exactly do you want to host the first workshop?**"
12. User: "In two months, on a Saturday."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **How could you measure the outcome of your workshop on nonprofit skills?**"
14. User: "Feedback forms and attendance numbers."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of hosting a workshop on nonprofit skills sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Finalizing the workshop agenda today.
2. Hosting the workshop in one month.
3. Increasing the difficulty by securing 3 guest speakers."
16. User: "I'll secure two guest speakers."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. User: "Yes, it's the right level."
19. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to host a workshop on nonprofit skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research and contact potential guest speakers.  
2. Design and distribute workshop promotional materials.  
3. Develop a detailed workshop agenda and materials."
20. User: "I'll contact guest speakers."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great first step! **Do you want to proceed with contacting guest speakers as your action?**"
22. User: "Yes, I'll start with that."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a productive plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of contacting guest speakers for the workshop? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will contact a guest speaker for the workshop.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll email a potential guest speaker.
3. If I close my laptop at the end of the workday, I will call a guest speaker."
24. User: "When I finish my morning coffee."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could help make this cue more concrete?**"
26. User: "In my home office."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days within the next 7 days when you plan to finish your morning coffee in your home office and contact the guest speakers?**"
28. User: "Monday and Wednesday mornings."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards hosting your workshop. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on contacting the speakers."
30. User: "Yes, that sounds good."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Host a workshop on nonprofit skills on the first Saturday in two months, measuring success through feedback forms and attendance numbers, and secure two guest speakers.

33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
