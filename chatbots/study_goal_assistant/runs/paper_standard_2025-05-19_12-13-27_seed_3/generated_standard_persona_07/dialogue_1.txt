Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to enhance community engagement skills."
3. CHATBOT: "That's a wonderful goal! Enhancing community engagement skills can have a significant impact on both your personal growth and the community you are involved with. **Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend local community events  
- Volunteer for community projects  
- Join community-focused groups"
4. USER: "I have some ideas, yes."
5. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "It's a good start, yes."
7. CHATBOT: "That's good to hear, and it means you should set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for enhancing your community engagement skills?**

For Example:
1. Host 3 community events by year-end.
2. Increase social media engagement by 20% in 6 months.
3. Build 5 new community partnerships by next quarter."
8. USER: "Host a monthly community workshop."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of hosting a monthly community workshop already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Host a community workshop on the first Saturday monthly."
10. USER: "Host a workshop on nonprofit skills."
11. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great idea! **When exactly do you want to host the first workshop?**"
12. USER: "In two months, on a Saturday."
13. CHATBOT: "Great! **How could you measure the outcome of your workshop on nonprofit skills?**"
14. USER: "Feedback forms and attendance numbers."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of hosting a workshop on nonprofit skills sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Finalizing the workshop agenda today.
2. Hosting the workshop in one month.
3. Increasing the difficulty by securing 3 guest speakers."
16. USER: "I'll secure two guest speakers."
17. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
18. USER: "Yes, it's the right level."
19. CHATBOT: "It's fantastic that you've set a clear goal to host a workshop on nonprofit skills. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research and contact potential guest speakers.  
2. Design and distribute workshop promotional materials.  
3. Develop a detailed workshop agenda and materials."
20. USER: "I'll contact guest speakers."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great first step! **Do you want to proceed with contacting guest speakers as your action?**"
22. USER: "Yes, I'll start with that."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a productive plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of contacting guest speakers for the workshop? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will contact a guest speaker for the workshop.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll email a potential guest speaker.
3. If I close my laptop at the end of the workday, I will call a guest speaker."
24. USER: "When I finish my morning coffee."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that could help make this cue more concrete?**"
26. USER: "In my home office."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific day or days within the next 7 days when you plan to finish your morning coffee in your home office and contact the guest speakers?**"
28. USER: "Monday and Wednesday mornings."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards hosting your workshop. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on contacting the speakers."
30. USER: "Yes, that sounds good."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Host a workshop on nonprofit skills on the first Saturday in two months, measuring success through feedback forms and attendance numbers, and secure two guest speakers.

**Action:** Contact guest speakers for the workshop.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in my home office on Monday and Wednesday mornings then contact guest speakers for the workshop."
