Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'd love to structure daily learning!"
3. CHATBOT: "Structuring daily learning sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your skills, gaining new knowledge, or advancing in your career. **Would you still like to keep structuring daily learning as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "I'd like to gain new knowledge."
5. CHATBOT: "That's wonderful! Gaining new knowledge is a fantastic goal that can open up many opportunities and enrich your life.

**Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind for how you plan to gain this new knowledge?**

For example:  
- Regularly read educational books  
- Attend workshops and seminars  
- Join online learning platforms"
6. USER: "I enjoy reading educational books!"
7. CHATBOT: "That's a great strategy! Reading educational books can provide a wealth of information and insights.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of gaining new knowledge?**"
8. USER: "Yes, it's a good start!"
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for reading educational books?**

For Example:
1. Read 12 educational books in 6 months.  
2. Complete 3 online courses by year-end.  
3. Attend 5 educational workshops this quarter.  "
10. USER: "Read 12 books in 6 months!"
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of reading 12 books already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Finish 2 books by June 30th, 2025.'"
12. USER: "Finish 2 books by January."
13. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in January do you want to finish the 2 books?**"
14. USER: "By January 31st."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of finishing 2 books by January 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Finishing 2 books by December 31st.  
2. Reading 3 books by January 31st.  
3. Completing 2 books by January 15th."
16. USER: "I’ll stick with January 31st!"
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of finishing 2 books by January 31st is a great commitment! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 30 pages daily.  
2. Listen to audiobooks during commutes.  
3. Schedule dedicated reading time each evening."
18. USER: "Read 30 pages daily!"
19. CHATBOT: "That's a solid plan! **Do you think reading 30 pages daily is the best action to help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
20. USER: "Yes, it's the best action!"
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great commitment! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading 30 pages daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 30 pages.
2. When I sit down on my couch after dinner, I'll read 30 pages.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 30 pages."
22. USER: "When I sit down after dinner!"
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually sit down after dinner** that would make this cue even more concrete and reliable?"
24. USER: "On my comfy living room couch!"
25. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Your living room couch is a perfect, consistent location. **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to start this routine?**"
26. USER: "“Starting this Monday sounds good!”"
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards finishing your books. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily reading."
28. USER: "Sounds great, I’d like that!"
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Finish 2 books by January 31st.

**Action:** Read 30 pages daily

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down on my comfy living room couch after dinner on Monday, I will read 30 pages daily"
30. USER: "Thanks for your help!"
31. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
