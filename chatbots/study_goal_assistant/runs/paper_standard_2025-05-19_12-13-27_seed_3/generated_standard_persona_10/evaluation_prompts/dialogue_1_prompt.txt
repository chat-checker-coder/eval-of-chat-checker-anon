system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd love to structure daily learning!"
3. Chatbot: "Structuring daily learning sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your skills, gaining new knowledge, or advancing in your career. **Would you still like to keep structuring daily learning as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I'd like to gain new knowledge."
5. Chatbot: "That's wonderful! Gaining new knowledge is a fantastic goal that can open up many opportunities and enrich your life.

**Do you already have a strategy or a procedure in mind for how you plan to gain this new knowledge?**

For example:  
- Regularly read educational books  
- Attend workshops and seminars  
- Join online learning platforms"
6. User: "I enjoy reading educational books!"
7. Chatbot: "That's a great strategy! Reading educational books can provide a wealth of information and insights.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of gaining new knowledge?**"
8. User: "Yes, it's a good start!"
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for reading educational books?**

For Example:
1. Read 12 educational books in 6 months.  
2. Complete 3 online courses by year-end.  
3. Attend 5 educational workshops this quarter.  "
10. User: "Read 12 books in 6 months!"
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of reading 12 books already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Finish 2 books by June 30th, 2025.'"
12. User: "Finish 2 books by January."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. **When exactly in January do you want to finish the 2 books?**"
14. User: "By January 31st."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of finishing 2 books by January 31st sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Finishing 2 books by December 31st.  
2. Reading 3 books by January 31st.  
3. Completing 2 books by January 15th."
16. User: "I’ll stick with January 31st!"
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of finishing 2 books by January 31st is a great commitment! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 30 pages daily.  
2. Listen to audiobooks during commutes.  
3. Schedule dedicated reading time each evening."
18. User: "Read 30 pages daily!"
19. Chatbot: "That's a solid plan! **Do you think reading 30 pages daily is the best action to help you reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
20. User: "Yes, it's the best action!"
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great commitment! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading 30 pages daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 30 pages.
2. When I sit down on my couch after dinner, I'll read 30 pages.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 30 pages."
22. User: "When I sit down after dinner!"
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually sit down after dinner** that would make this cue even more concrete and reliable?"
24. User: "On my comfy living room couch!"
25. Chatbot: "Great choice! Your living room couch is a perfect, consistent location. **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to start this routine?**"
26. User: "“Starting this Monday sounds good!”"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards finishing your books. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily reading."
28. User: "Sounds great, I’d like that!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Finish 2 books by January 31st.

**Action:** Read 30 pages daily

**Implementation Intention:** when I sit down on my comfy living room couch after dinner on Monday, I will read 30 pages daily"
30. User: "Thanks for your help!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
