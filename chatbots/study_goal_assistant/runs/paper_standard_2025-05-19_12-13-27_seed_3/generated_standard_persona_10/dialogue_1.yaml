        learning as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more
        overarching goal.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is relevant to the user's input about structuring
            daily learning. It correctly identifies that structuring daily learning
            might be a means to a broader goal rather than a goal itself. The chatbot
            then offers the user a choice to either keep it as the primary goal or
            consider a more overarching goal. This response is aligned with the chatbot's
            purpose of guiding the user in goal setting. There is no indication of

            it then asks the user if they think this strategy is already a good strategy
            to achieve their goal of gaining new knowledge. This question seems redundant
            because the user has already expressed enjoyment in reading educational
            books, implying they see it as a beneficial strategy. The chatbot should
            instead focus on helping the user develop a specific plan or action step
