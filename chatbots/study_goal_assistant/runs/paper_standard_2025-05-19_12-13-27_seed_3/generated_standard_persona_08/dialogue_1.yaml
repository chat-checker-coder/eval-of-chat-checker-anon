    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural, but there were
            moments where the phrasing felt slightly robotic, particularly when repeatedly
            asking if the user could make the goal more challenging. This repetition
            affected the natural flow of the conversation, making it feel less human-like.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It successfully helped the user define a specific
            and challenging goal and formulate an implementation intention. However,
            minor inefficiencies and slightly robotic phrasing affected the overall
            experience, preventing a perfect score.
