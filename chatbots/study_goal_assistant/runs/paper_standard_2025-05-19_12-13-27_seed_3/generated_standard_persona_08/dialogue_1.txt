Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want stable freelance income."
3. CHATBOT: "Achieving a stable freelance income is a fantastic goal! It can provide you with flexibility and control over your work-life balance. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Established client network  
- Diverse skill set  
- Consistent project delivery"
4. USER: "I rely on word-of-mouth."
5. CHATBOT: "Relying on word-of-mouth can be a powerful strategy if you have a strong network. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal of stable freelance income?**"
6. USER: "Not really, it's too unpredictable."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve stable freelance income. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different freelance platforms and identify which ones align with your skills and target market.
2. Learn effective marketing strategies to promote your freelance services and attract consistent clients.
3. Study financial management techniques to budget and manage irregular freelance income effectively."
8. USER: "Learn effective marketing strategies."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning effective marketing strategies already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five marketing strategies by June 2, 2025."
10. USER: "I'll identify 3 strategies by December."
11. CHATBOT: "**When exactly in December do you want to achieve this goal?**"
12. USER: "Mid-December sounds good."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'identifying 3 marketing strategies by mid-December' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying 3 strategies by today.  
2. Identifying 3 strategies by end of May.  
3. Identifying 5 strategies by mid-December."
14. USER: "I'll identify 5 strategies."
15. CHATBOT: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, perhaps by setting a deadline earlier than mid-December?**"
16. USER: "I can aim for November."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic adjustment! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most you can push it for now?**"
18. USER: "That's as much as I can."
19. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify 5 marketing strategies by November. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on marketing strategies.  
2. Attend a marketing webinar.  
3. Interview 3 successful freelancers.  "
20. USER: "I'll attend a marketing webinar."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a productive action to take! **Do you think attending a webinar will provide you with the insights you need, or is there another action you might consider as well?**"
22. USER: "I might read a marketing book."
23. CHATBOT: "Both attending a webinar and reading a marketing book are excellent actions to gain insights. **Would you like to proceed with attending the webinar as your primary action for now?**"
24. USER: "Yes, let's start with that."
25. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Attending a marketing webinar can be really insightful. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of attending the webinar? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will attend a marketing webinar.
2. When I log off my work computer at 5 PM, I'll join a marketing webinar.
3. If I pour my morning coffee, I will schedule time for a marketing webinar."
26. USER: "Every Friday after lunch."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Where do you usually have lunch on Fridays?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific location."
28. USER: "At a cafe near my home."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! So your implementation intention could be: "When I finish my lunch at the cafe near my home on Friday, I will attend a marketing webinar." **Does this sound good to you?**"
30. USER: "Yes, that sounds great!"
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your webinar."
32. USER: "Sure, I'd appreciate that!"
33. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify 5 marketing strategies by November.

**Action:** attend a marketing webinar

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my lunch at the cafe near my home on Friday, I will attend a marketing webinar."
34. USER: "Thank you for your help!"
