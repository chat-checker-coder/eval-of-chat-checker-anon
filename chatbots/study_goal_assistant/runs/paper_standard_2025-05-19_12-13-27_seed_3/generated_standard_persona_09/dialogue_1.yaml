        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural and conversational,
            though slightly formal. The use of examples and questions helped maintain
            a human-like interaction. However, the repeated use of phrases like 'sounds
            like a great action' could be seen as slightly robotic.
        rating: 4
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed excellently in guiding the user
            through the goal-setting process. It was successful in helping the user
            define a specific and challenging goal, and the conversation was efficient
            and appropriate. Minor improvements could be made in the naturalness of
            the language used.
