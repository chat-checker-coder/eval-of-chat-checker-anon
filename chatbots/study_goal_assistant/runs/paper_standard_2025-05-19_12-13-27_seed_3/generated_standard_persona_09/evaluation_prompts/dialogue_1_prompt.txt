system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm integrating tech into teaching."
3. Chatbot: "Integrating tech into teaching sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing student engagement, improving learning outcomes, or modernizing the curriculum. **Would you still like to keep integrating tech into teaching as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Let's aim to enhance learning."
5. Chatbot: "Enhancing learning is a wonderful goal! It can have a profound impact on both students and educators, leading to more effective and engaging educational experiences. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use active recall techniques.  
- Implement spaced repetition.  
- Practice interleaved learning."
6. User: "Utilize interactive tech tools."
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a promising approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "Yes, it's a great start."
9. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for utilizing interactive tech tools to enhance learning?**

For Example:
1. Increase student engagement by 20% using interactive tools.
2. Improve test scores by 15% through tech-based learning.
3. Boost class participation by 30% with interactive platforms."
10. User: "Improve student engagement by 25%."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of improving student engagement already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Increase student engagement by 25% by December 31, 2025."
12. User: "Increase engagement by 25% this year."
13. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
14. User: "Through attendance and participation data."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of increasing student engagement sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Achieving a 30% increase by December 31, 2023.
2. Reaching a 25% increase by September 30, 2023.
3. Implementing three new strategies by June 30, 2023."
16. User: "Achieve a 30% increase this year."
17. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
18. User: "This is my most challenging goal."
19. Chatbot: "It's impressive that you've set such a challenging goal to increase student engagement. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Implement interactive teaching methods in class.  
2. Use gamification to boost student participation.  
3. Conduct regular feedback sessions with students.  "
20. User: "Implement interactive teaching methods."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to increase student engagement. **Do you want to proceed with implementing interactive teaching methods as your action?**"
22. User: "Yes, let's proceed with it."
23. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic step towards enhancing student engagement. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of interactive teaching methods? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my first class of the day, I will use interactive teaching methods.
2. When I see students entering the classroom, I'll incorporate interactive activities into the lesson.
3. If I finish reviewing the lesson plan, I will add an interactive element to it."
24. User: "When I start the class, I'll use interactive methods."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day and location where you will start the class and implement these interactive methods?**"
26. User: "I'll start on Monday in Room 101."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! Starting on Monday in Room 101 provides a clear and consistent environment for your cue. **Are you satisfied with this cue, or would you like to adjust anything?**"
28. User: "I'm satisfied with this cue."
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards increased engagement. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your interactive methods."
30. User: "Yes, please check in next week."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve a 30% increase in student engagement through attendance and participation data by December 31, 2023.

**Action:** Implement interactive teaching methods

**Implementation Intention:** when I start the class on Monday in Room 101, I'll use interactive methods."
32. User: "Thank you for the summary!"
33. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
