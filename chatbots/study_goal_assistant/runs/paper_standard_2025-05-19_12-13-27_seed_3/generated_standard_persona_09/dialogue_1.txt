Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm integrating tech into teaching."
3. CHATBOT: "Integrating tech into teaching sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing student engagement, improving learning outcomes, or modernizing the curriculum. **Would you still like to keep integrating tech into teaching as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Let's aim to enhance learning."
5. CHATBOT: "Enhancing learning is a wonderful goal! It can have a profound impact on both students and educators, leading to more effective and engaging educational experiences. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Use active recall techniques.  
- Implement spaced repetition.  
- Practice interleaved learning."
6. USER: "Utilize interactive tech tools."
7. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a promising approach! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. USER: "Yes, it's a great start."
9. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **What could be a performance goal for utilizing interactive tech tools to enhance learning?**

For Example:
1. Increase student engagement by 20% using interactive tools.
2. Improve test scores by 15% through tech-based learning.
3. Boost class participation by 30% with interactive platforms."
10. USER: "Improve student engagement by 25%."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of improving student engagement already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Increase student engagement by 25% by December 31, 2025."
12. USER: "Increase engagement by 25% this year."
13. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
14. USER: "Through attendance and participation data."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of increasing student engagement sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Achieving a 30% increase by December 31, 2023.
2. Reaching a 25% increase by September 30, 2023.
3. Implementing three new strategies by June 30, 2023."
16. USER: "Achieve a 30% increase this year."
17. CHATBOT: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the most challenging yet achievable goal for you?**"
18. USER: "This is my most challenging goal."
19. CHATBOT: "It's impressive that you've set such a challenging goal to increase student engagement. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Implement interactive teaching methods in class.  
2. Use gamification to boost student participation.  
3. Conduct regular feedback sessions with students.  "
20. USER: "Implement interactive teaching methods."
21. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great action to increase student engagement. **Do you want to proceed with implementing interactive teaching methods as your action?**"
22. USER: "Yes, let's proceed with it."
23. CHATBOT: "That's a fantastic step towards enhancing student engagement. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of interactive teaching methods? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my first class of the day, I will use interactive teaching methods.
2. When I see students entering the classroom, I'll incorporate interactive activities into the lesson.
3. If I finish reviewing the lesson plan, I will add an interactive element to it."
24. USER: "When I start the class, I'll use interactive methods."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day and location where you will start the class and implement these interactive methods?**"
26. USER: "I'll start on Monday in Room 101."
27. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Starting on Monday in Room 101 provides a clear and consistent environment for your cue. **Are you satisfied with this cue, or would you like to adjust anything?**"
28. USER: "I'm satisfied with this cue."
29. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards increased engagement. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your interactive methods."
30. USER: "Yes, please check in next week."
31. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Achieve a 30% increase in student engagement through attendance and participation data by December 31, 2023.

**Action:** Implement interactive teaching methods

**Implementation Intention:** when I start the class on Monday in Room 101, I'll use interactive methods."
32. USER: "Thank you for the summary!"
33. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
