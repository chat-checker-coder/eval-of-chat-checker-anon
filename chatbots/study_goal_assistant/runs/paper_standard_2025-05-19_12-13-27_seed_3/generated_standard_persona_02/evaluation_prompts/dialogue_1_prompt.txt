system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Improving my leadership skills."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your leadership skills is a fantastic goal! Leadership is such a valuable skill that can positively impact both your personal and professional life. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops regularly.  
- Seek mentorship from experienced leaders.  
- Practice active listening daily."
4. User: "Seek mentorship from experienced leaders."
5. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid approach! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "Yes, I think it is."
7. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for improving your leadership skills?**

For Example:
1. Lead a successful team project by Q2.
2. Facilitate monthly leadership workshops for peers.
3. Increase team productivity by 15% within six months."
8. User: "Lead a successful team project."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of leading a successful team project already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete team project by July 31st with 95% client satisfaction."
10. User: "Complete the project by June."
11. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. User: "Achieve 90% client satisfaction."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of completing the project by June with 90% client satisfaction sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Completing the project by May 31.  
2. Achieving 95% client satisfaction.  
3. Delivering a prototype by next Monday."
14. User: "Deliver a prototype by May 1."
15. Chatbot: "Delivering a prototype by May 1 sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. User: "This is the right level."
17. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear and challenging goal to complete the project by June with 90% client satisfaction and deliver a prototype by May 1. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Conduct weekly team progress meetings.  
2. Gather client feedback bi-weekly.  
3. Develop prototype milestones and deadlines.  "
18. User: "Conduct weekly team progress meetings."
19. Chatbot: "Conducting weekly team progress meetings is a great way to ensure everyone is aligned and on track. **Do you think this action will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. User: "Yes, this will help."
21. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Conducting weekly team progress meetings can really enhance team alignment and productivity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Monday morning coffee, I will schedule the weekly team progress meeting.
2. When I log into my work computer on Monday, I'll conduct the weekly team progress meeting.
3. If I see the calendar reminder for Monday, I will hold the weekly team progress meeting."
22. User: "When I log into my work computer on Monday, I'll conduct the meeting."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is the location where you log into your work computer a consistent physical place, like your office or home office?**"
24. User: "Yes, it’s my office."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards project completion. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your team meetings."
26. User: "Sure, that works for me."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete the project by June with 90% client satisfaction and deliver a prototype by May 1.

**Action:** Conduct weekly team progress meetings.

**Implementation Intention:** when I log into my work computer on Monday in my office, I'll conduct the weekly team progress meeting."
28. User: "Thanks for your help!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
