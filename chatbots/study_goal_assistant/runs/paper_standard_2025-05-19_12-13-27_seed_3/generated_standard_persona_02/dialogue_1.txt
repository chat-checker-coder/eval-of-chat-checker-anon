Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Improving my leadership skills."
3. CHATBOT: "Improving your leadership skills is a fantastic goal! Leadership is such a valuable skill that can positively impact both your personal and professional life. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Attend leadership workshops regularly.  
- Seek mentorship from experienced leaders.  
- Practice active listening daily."
4. USER: "Seek mentorship from experienced leaders."
5. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid approach! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. USER: "Yes, I think it is."
7. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for improving your leadership skills?**

For Example:
1. Lead a successful team project by Q2.
2. Facilitate monthly leadership workshops for peers.
3. Increase team productivity by 15% within six months."
8. USER: "Lead a successful team project."
9. CHATBOT: "Your goal of leading a successful team project already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Complete team project by July 31st with 95% client satisfaction."
10. USER: "Complete the project by June."
11. CHATBOT: "I think you are missing a concrete outcome in your goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
12. USER: "Achieve 90% client satisfaction."
13. CHATBOT: "Your goal of completing the project by June with 90% client satisfaction sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Completing the project by May 31.  
2. Achieving 95% client satisfaction.  
3. Delivering a prototype by next Monday."
14. USER: "Deliver a prototype by May 1."
15. CHATBOT: "Delivering a prototype by May 1 sounds like a great way to make your goal more challenging. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
16. USER: "This is the right level."
17. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear and challenging goal to complete the project by June with 90% client satisfaction and deliver a prototype by May 1. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Conduct weekly team progress meetings.  
2. Gather client feedback bi-weekly.  
3. Develop prototype milestones and deadlines.  "
18. USER: "Conduct weekly team progress meetings."
19. CHATBOT: "Conducting weekly team progress meetings is a great way to ensure everyone is aligned and on track. **Do you think this action will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you want to consider?**"
20. USER: "Yes, this will help."
21. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! Conducting weekly team progress meetings can really enhance team alignment and productivity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my Monday morning coffee, I will schedule the weekly team progress meeting.
2. When I log into my work computer on Monday, I'll conduct the weekly team progress meeting.
3. If I see the calendar reminder for Monday, I will hold the weekly team progress meeting."
22. USER: "When I log into my work computer on Monday, I'll conduct the meeting."
23. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is the location where you log into your work computer a consistent physical place, like your office or home office?**"
24. USER: "Yes, it’s my office."
25. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards project completion. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your team meetings."
26. USER: "Sure, that works for me."
27. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Complete the project by June with 90% client satisfaction and deliver a prototype by May 1.

**Action:** Conduct weekly team progress meetings.

**Implementation Intention:** when I log into my work computer on Monday in my office, I'll conduct the weekly team progress meeting."
28. USER: "Thanks for your help!"
29. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
