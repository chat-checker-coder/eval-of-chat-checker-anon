system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'd love to improve my work-life balance."
3. Chatbot: "Improving your work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can lead to a more fulfilling and less stressful life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Set clear work boundaries  
- Schedule regular personal time  
- Prioritize self-care activities"
4. User: "I try scheduling personal time, but it's tough."
5. Chatbot: "It sounds like you're making an effort with scheduling personal time, but it might not be fully effective yet. **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
6. User: "It’s definitely a good start!"
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your work-life balance. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify time management techniques that can help you allocate time effectively between work and personal life.
   
2. Learn about stress management strategies to help reduce work-related stress and improve overall well-being.

3. Explore and understand the concept of setting boundaries and how to communicate them effectively in a professional environment."
8. User: "I want to master time management techniques."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering time management techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Learn five time management techniques by June 2, 2025."
10. User: "I aim to learn three techniques by May 1, 2024."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning time management techniques sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Learning three techniques by today.  
2. Mastering three techniques by June 1, 2024.  
3. Identifying five techniques before choosing three."
12. User: "I'll aim to master three by June 1, 2024."
13. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
14. User: "This feels just right for me."
15. Chatbot: "It's fantastic that you've set a goal to master three time management techniques by June 1, 2024. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 books on time management strategies.  
2. Attend a time management workshop or seminar.  
3. Watch 5 expert-led time management webinars.  "
16. User: "I'll start by reading one book."
17. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **Do you have a specific book in mind, or would you like a recommendation?**"
18. User: "I'd love a recommendation, please."
19. Chatbot: "A highly recommended book on time management is "Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity" by David Allen. **Does this book sound like a good fit for you to start with?**"
20. User: "Yes, it sounds perfect!"
21. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Reading "Getting Things Done" will surely help you enhance your productivity. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading this book? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read 10 pages of 'Getting Things Done'.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll read a chapter of 'Getting Things Done'.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will read 'Getting Things Done' for 15 minutes."
22. User: "When I finish dinner, I'll read 15 pages."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you?**"
24. User: "I usually have dinner in the kitchen."
25. Chatbot: "Great! Having dinner in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish dinner in the kitchen, I'll read 15 pages of 'Getting Things Done'"?**"
26. User: "Yes, that's perfect for me."
27. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering time management. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
28. User: "That would be great, thank you!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master three time management techniques by June 1, 2024.

**Action:** Read 'Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity' by David Allen.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish dinner in the kitchen, I'll read 15 pages of 'Getting Things Done'"
30. User: "Thanks for the help!"
31. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
