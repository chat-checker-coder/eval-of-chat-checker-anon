system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want better time management."
3. Chatbot: "Improving time management sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as increasing productivity, achieving work-life balance, or reducing stress. **Would you still like to keep better time management as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, achieving work-life balance."
5. Chatbot: "Achieving work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can greatly enhance your overall well-being and satisfaction. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Set clear boundaries  
- Prioritize self-care activities  
- Schedule regular breaks"
6. User: "I'm trying to prioritize self-care."
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! **Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
8. User: "It's helpful but needs tweaking."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve work-life balance. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify time management techniques that can help you allocate time effectively between work and personal life.
   
2. Learn about stress management strategies to help maintain mental and emotional well-being in both professional and personal settings.

3. Explore and understand the concept of setting boundaries and how to communicate them effectively to maintain a healthy work-life balance."
10. User: "I'll research time management techniques."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching time management techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five time management techniques by Friday, 2025-05-23."
12. User: "I'll find three techniques weekly."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **When exactly do you want to start this weekly research?**"
14. User: "I can start next Monday."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of achieving work-life balance sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Researching three techniques today.  
2. Researching six techniques weekly.  
3. Identifying nine techniques before choosing one."
16. User: "I'll stick with three weekly."
17. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to research three time management techniques weekly starting from October 16th. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read three articles on time management techniques.  
2. Watch three YouTube videos on time management.  
3. Listen to three podcasts on time management strategies."
18. User: "I'll watch three videos first."
19. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! Watching videos can be a very engaging way to learn. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching these three YouTube videos on time management techniques? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will watch three YouTube videos on time management.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll watch three YouTube videos on time management.
3. If I make my morning coffee, I will watch three YouTube videos on time management."
20. User: "I'll watch after breakfast."
21. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that could serve as a reliable cue for you to start watching the videos?**"
22. User: "I usually have breakfast in the kitchen."
23. Chatbot: "Great! Having breakfast in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Would you like to set your implementation intention as "When I sit down at my desk after breakfast in the kitchen, I'll watch three YouTube videos on time management techniques"?**"
24. User: "Yes, that sounds perfect."
25. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards researching techniques. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your video watching."
26. User: "Sure, that would be great!"
27. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research three time management techniques weekly starting from Monday, 2023-10-16.

**Action:** Watch three YouTube videos on time management techniques.

**Implementation Intention:** When I sit down at my desk after breakfast in the kitchen, I'll watch three YouTube videos on time management techniques."
28. User: "Thanks for the summary!"
29. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
