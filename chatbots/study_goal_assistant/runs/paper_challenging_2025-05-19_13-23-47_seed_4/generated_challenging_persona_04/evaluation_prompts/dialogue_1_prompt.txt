system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I've several goals right now."
3. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Having multiple goals can be motivating. **Could you share one of your goals with me so we can focus on it together?**"
4. User: "I'm not sure where to start."
5. Chatbot: "No worries, I’m here to help! **What are you currently working on, or where do you see yourself in 5 years?**"
6. User: "I juggle health, career, fun."
7. Chatbot: "Balancing health, career, and fun is important! **Would you like to focus on a specific area, like improving your health, advancing your career, or finding more time for fun?**"
8. User: "Can we prioritize all three?"
9. Chatbot: "Absolutely, we can work on setting goals for all three areas. **Which one would you like to start with: health, career, or fun?**"
10. User: "Career, but health's crucial too."
11. Chatbot: "Great choice! We can focus on a career goal while keeping health in mind. **What’s one career goal you’d like to achieve, perhaps a promotion, skill development, or a new job?**"
12. User: "Maybe learning a new skill?"
13. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic decision! Learning a new skill can open up so many opportunities and is a wonderful way to grow both personally and professionally. 

**Do you already have a strategy or a plan in mind for how you want to learn this new skill?**

For example:  
- Enroll in relevant courses  
- Seek mentorship opportunities  
- Attend industry workshops"
14. User: "I could try all three."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great approach with multiple strategies in mind! 

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
16. User: "It might be overwhelming."
17. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your career advancement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in an online course or workshop that focuses on the specific skill you want to acquire for career advancement.
   
2. Research and read books or articles written by experts in the field to gain a deeper understanding of the skill and its applications in your industry.

3. Find a mentor or join a professional group where you can practice the skill and receive feedback from experienced individuals."
18. User: "Finding a mentor sounds cool."
19. Chatbot: "Finding a mentor is a great way to gain insights and guidance in your career journey. 

**How could you formulate this as a learning goal?**"
20. User: "Connect with an industry mentor."
21. Chatbot: "Connecting with an industry mentor is a valuable step. 

**How could you further define this as a learning goal, such as identifying specific skills or knowledge you want to gain from the mentorship?**"
22. User: "Gain insights on leadership skills."
23. Chatbot: "Your goal of gaining insights on leadership skills already sounds good. 

**Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three leadership strategies with mentor by June 30."
24. User: "Discuss leadership styles with mentor."
25. Chatbot: "I think you are missing a concrete time in your goal. 

**When exactly do you want to discuss leadership styles with your mentor?**"
26. User: "Maybe sometime next month?"
27. Chatbot: "I understand you're aiming for next month. 

**Could you specify an exact date in the next month for discussing leadership styles with your mentor?**"
28. User: "Not sure. Could be 15th?"
29. Chatbot: "Great! You've chosen the 15th. 

**How could you measure the outcome of your discussion on leadership styles with your mentor?**"
30. User: "Summarize three actionable steps."
31. Chatbot: "Your goal of discussing leadership styles with your mentor and summarizing three actionable steps by the 15th of next month sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Discussing leadership styles with mentor today.  
2. Summarizing actionable steps by end of this week.  
3. Or increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
32. User: "That's too tough to plan."
33. Chatbot: "I understand, it's important to set a goal that feels achievable for you. 

**Would you like to keep your original goal as it is, or is there a small adjustment you think you could make to make it slightly more challenging?**"
34. User: "Let's stick with original."
35. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to discuss leadership styles with your mentor and summarize actionable steps. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read a book on leadership styles.  
2. Attend a leadership workshop or seminar.  
3. Listen to a podcast on effective leadership strategies."
36. User: "I might read a book."
37. Chatbot: "Reading a book on leadership styles is a great way to gain insights and prepare for your discussion with your mentor. **Do you have a specific book in mind, or would you like recommendations?**"
38. User: "I'm open to recommendations."
39. Chatbot: "Consider reading "Leaders Eat Last" by Simon Sinek or "The 5 Levels of Leadership" by John C. Maxwell. Both offer valuable insights into leadership styles and strategies. **Do you think reading one of these books will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you'd like to consider?**"
40. User: "One sounds good. Let's start."
41. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading "Leaders Eat Last"? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read 'Leaders Eat Last' for 15 minutes.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll read a chapter of 'Leaders Eat Last'.
3. If I pour my morning coffee, I will read 'Leaders Eat Last' for 10 minutes."
42. User: "When I pour my morning coffee."
43. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific day or days in the next 7 days when you plan to pour your morning coffee and read 'Leaders Eat Last'?**"
44. User: "Every weekday this week."
45. Chatbot: "Great choice! **Where will you be pouring your morning coffee each weekday this week?** This will help ensure the cue is tied to a specific location."
46. User: "My kitchen counter at home."
47. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards discussing leadership. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
48. User: "Sure, that sounds good."
49. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Discuss leadership styles with mentor and summarize three actionable steps by 15th of next month.

**Action:** Read 'Leaders Eat Last' by Simon Sinek to gain insights on leadership styles.

**Implementation Intention:** when I pour my morning coffee at my kitchen counter at home every weekday this week, then read 'Leaders Eat Last' by Simon Sinek to gain insights on leadership styles."
50. User: "Thanks for the help!"
51. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
