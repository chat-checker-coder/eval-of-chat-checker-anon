system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Lose weight fast."
3. Chatbot: ""Lose weight fast" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall health, increasing energy levels, or enhancing self-confidence. **Would you still like to keep "lose weight fast" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yes, just quick results, please."
5. Chatbot: "I understand your desire for quick results when it comes to losing weight. It's important to feel good about yourself and see progress. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to achieve this goal quickly?**

For example:  
- Intermittent fasting routine  
- High-intensity interval training  
- Meal prepping healthy options"
6. User: "Just tell me the fastest!"
7. Chatbot: "There are various strategies that people find effective, such as intermittent fasting or high-intensity interval training. However, it's important to choose a method that suits your lifestyle and health needs. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to achieve this goal quickly?**"
8. User: "No plan, just quick results!"
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your weight loss goal. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different dietary approaches and identify one that aligns with your lifestyle and weight loss goals.
2. Learn about the role of metabolism in weight loss and discover exercises that can boost your metabolic rate.
3. Study the impact of sleep and stress on weight management and find strategies to improve sleep quality and reduce stress."
10. User: "Still too slow. Just pick one!"
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching dietary approaches already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research 3 dietary approaches by Friday, choose one."
12. User: "There's no time. Decide now!"
13. Chatbot: "I understand the urgency. **When exactly do you want to have your research completed and a dietary approach chosen?**"
14. User: "Yesterday! Just pick for me!"
15. Chatbot: "I understand you're in a hurry. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal to ensure it aligns with your lifestyle and weight loss goals?**"
16. User: "Just want quick choice now!"
17. Chatbot: "I understand you're looking for a quick decision. **Would you like to set a specific date by which you want to have your dietary approach chosen and ready to implement?**"
18. User: "No date, just decide fast!"
19. Chatbot: "I understand your urgency, but I need your input to make it specific. **Could you tell me how you would measure the success of the dietary approach you choose?**"
20. User: "Success is losing weight fast!"
21. Chatbot: "Thank you for sharing that. **Would you like to set a specific date by which you want to have your dietary approach chosen and ready to implement, even if it's soon?**"
22. User: "No dates! Just need to start."
23. Chatbot: "I understand your need to start quickly. Let's focus on choosing a dietary approach that aligns with your goal of losing weight fast. **Would you like to explore options like low-carb, intermittent fasting, or another specific approach?**"
24. User: "Just choose one for me!"
25. Chatbot: "I understand your urgency, but I can't choose for you. **Would you like to explore a specific dietary approach like low-carb or intermittent fasting to start with?**"
26. User: "I said choose! Just pick!"
27. Chatbot: "I understand your urgency. Let's go with a low-carb diet as a starting point. You can begin researching it today and see if it aligns with your lifestyle and weight loss goals."
28. User: "Finally! I'll start now."
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching a low-carb diet sounds now more specific. 

**Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Deciding on the diet by 15:00 today.  
2. Researching and comparing three low-carb diets today.  
3. Identifying five potential challenges before deciding today."
30. User: "Already doing it. Thanks."
31. Chatbot: "It's great to hear that you're already working on researching a low-carb diet to see if it fits your lifestyle and weight loss goals. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 3 articles on low-carb diet benefits.  
2. Watch 2 expert interviews on low-carb diets.  
3. Join a low-carb diet online forum discussion.  "
32. User: "Just let me research first."
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan. **Would you like to proceed with the action of researching the low-carb diet today?**"
34. User: "Yes, I'll start now. Thanks."
35. Chatbot: "Great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of researching the low-carb diet today? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will research low-carb diets.
2. When I sit down at my desk after my afternoon walk, I'll explore low-carb diets.
3. If I make my afternoon coffee, I will read about low-carb diets."
36. User: "After a quick snack, research."
37. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have your quick snack** that could help you remember to research the low-carb diet?"
38. User: "At my desk, then research."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! **Does having your quick snack at your desk happen at a specific time or after a specific event** that could help make this cue more reliable?"
40. User: "Whenever I get hungry."
41. Chatbot: "That makes sense. **Is there a particular time of day when you usually get hungry for a snack at your desk**, so we can ensure the cue is more consistent?"
42. User: "Usually early afternoon."
43. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your lifestyle and weight loss goals. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
44. User: "*"No need. I'll update you."*"
45. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research low-carb diet today and decide if it aligns with my lifestyle and weight loss goals.

**Action:** Research low-carb diet today

**Implementation Intention:** when I have a quick snack at my desk in the early afternoon, I will research low-carb diets"
46. User: "Sounds good. Starting now."
47. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
