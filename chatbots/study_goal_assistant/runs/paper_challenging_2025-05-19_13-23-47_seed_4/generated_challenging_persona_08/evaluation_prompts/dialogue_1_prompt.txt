system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure it's effective."
3. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging to pinpoint a goal. **What are you currently working on, or where do you want to be in 5 years?**"
4. User: "I'm not really sure yet."
5. Chatbot: "That's okay! Let's explore this together. **What are you struggling with right now, or what would you like to improve in your life?**"
6. User: "Advancing in my career, I guess."
7. Chatbot: "Advancing in your career is a fantastic goal and can lead to many exciting opportunities and personal growth. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you advance in your career?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders.  
- Pursuing relevant certifications.  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities."
8. User: "I doubt a plan will help."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve advancing in your career. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in a professional development course relevant to your field to enhance your skills and knowledge.
2. Research and learn about the key competencies and qualifications required for the next level in your career path.
3. Seek mentorship from a successful professional in your industry to gain insights and advice on career advancement strategies."
10. User: "Not sure if that helps."
11. Chatbot: "I understand it can be challenging to pinpoint a learning goal. **What specific skills or knowledge do you think you need to acquire to advance in your career?**"
12. User: "Honestly, I'm not sure."
13. Chatbot: "That's completely okay. Let's try to break it down. **Is there a particular area or skill in your current role that you feel could be improved or expanded upon?**"
14. User: "I suppose my communication skills."
15. Chatbot: "Improving communication skills is a great learning goal that can significantly impact your career advancement. **How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, you might aim to develop specific communication strategies or techniques."
16. User: "Not convinced it'll work."
17. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. Communication skills are broad, so focusing on specific aspects like public speaking, active listening, or writing could be more effective. **Which specific area of communication would you like to improve?**"
18. User: "I'm uncertain about public speaking."
19. Chatbot: "Improving public speaking is a valuable skill that can boost your confidence and career prospects. **Would you like to set a learning goal to develop public speaking techniques or strategies?**"
20. User: "I guess that makes sense."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of developing public speaking techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three public speaking techniques by June 2, 2025."
22. User: "I'll think about it."
23. Chatbot: "Take your time to think it over. **When you're ready, could you share the specific details of your goal?**"
24. User: "I'm still not sure."
25. Chatbot: "That's completely okay. **Would you like some help in identifying a specific time or measurable outcome for your goal?**"
26. User: "I suppose that might help."
27. Chatbot: "Great! **When exactly do you want to achieve your goal of developing public speaking techniques?**"
28. User: "I'm not sure about a date."
29. Chatbot: "No worries, let's focus on a measurable outcome first. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal in terms of public speaking techniques?**"
30. User: "Maybe feedback or presentation success."
31. Chatbot: "Feedback and presentation success are excellent ways to measure your progress. **Would you like to set a specific date by which you aim to receive positive feedback or achieve a successful presentation?**"
32. User: "I guess that could work."
33. Chatbot: "Great! **Do you have a specific date in mind for when you'd like to achieve this feedback or presentation success?**"
34. User: "I'm really unsure about dates."
35. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine. **Would you like to set a general timeframe, like within the next 6 months, to give yourself some flexibility?**"
36. User: "Six months sounds manageable, maybe."
37. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan. **Would you like to set a goal to receive positive feedback or achieve a successful presentation within the next six months?**"
38. User: "I guess that's a start."
39. Chatbot: "Your goal of receiving positive feedback or achieving a successful presentation sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Scheduling a practice presentation today.  
2. Achieving positive feedback within three months.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by presenting to a larger audience."
40. User: "I doubt that's doable for me."
41. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to receive positive feedback or achieve a successful presentation within the next six months. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Attend a public speaking workshop.  
2. Read a book on presentation skills.  
3. Practice presentations with a mentor."
42. User: "Maybe read a book first."
43. Chatbot: "Reading a book on presentation skills is a great start! **Do you think this action will help you achieve your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
44. User: "It might help a bit."
45. Chatbot: "That's a good step forward. **Would you like to proceed with reading a book on presentation skills as your action, or explore other actions?**"
46. User: "I'm okay with the book."
47. Chatbot: "Great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading a book on presentation skills? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will read a book on presentation skills.
2. When I sit down at my desk in the morning, I'll read a book on presentation skills.
3. If I make my evening tea, I will read a book on presentation skills."
48. User: "I'll read during lunch."
49. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **Will you be reading at a specific location during your lunch break, like in the office cafeteria or a nearby park?**"
50. User: "I might read at my desk."
51. Chatbot: "Reading at your desk during lunch is a convenient choice. **Do you plan to start this routine on a specific day this week?**"
