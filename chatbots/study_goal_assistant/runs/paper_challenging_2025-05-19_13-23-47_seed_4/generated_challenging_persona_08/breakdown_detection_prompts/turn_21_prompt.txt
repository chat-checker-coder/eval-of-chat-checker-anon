system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure it's effective."
3. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging to pinpoint a goal. **What are you currently working on, or where do you want to be in 5 years?**"
4. User: "I'm not really sure yet."
5. Chatbot: "That's okay! Let's explore this together. **What are you struggling with right now, or what would you like to improve in your life?**"
6. User: "Advancing in my career, I guess."
7. Chatbot: "Advancing in your career is a fantastic goal and can lead to many exciting opportunities and personal growth. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you advance in your career?**

For example:  
- Networking with industry leaders.  
- Pursuing relevant certifications.  
- Seeking mentorship opportunities."
8. User: "I doubt a plan will help."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve advancing in your career. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and enroll in a professional development course relevant to your field to enhance your skills and knowledge.
2. Research and learn about the key competencies and qualifications required for the next level in your career path.
3. Seek mentorship from a successful professional in your industry to gain insights and advice on career advancement strategies."
10. User: "Not sure if that helps."
11. Chatbot: "I understand it can be challenging to pinpoint a learning goal. **What specific skills or knowledge do you think you need to acquire to advance in your career?**"
12. User: "Honestly, I'm not sure."
13. Chatbot: "That's completely okay. Let's try to break it down. **Is there a particular area or skill in your current role that you feel could be improved or expanded upon?**"
14. User: "I suppose my communication skills."
15. Chatbot: "Improving communication skills is a great learning goal that can significantly impact your career advancement. **How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, you might aim to develop specific communication strategies or techniques."
16. User: "Not convinced it'll work."
17. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. Communication skills are broad, so focusing on specific aspects like public speaking, active listening, or writing could be more effective. **Which specific area of communication would you like to improve?**"
18. User: "I'm uncertain about public speaking."
19. Chatbot: "Improving public speaking is a valuable skill that can boost your confidence and career prospects. **Would you like to set a learning goal to develop public speaking techniques or strategies?**"
20. User: "I guess that makes sense."

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of developing public speaking techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three public speaking techniques by June 2, 2025."
