Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Career advancement, but unsure how."
3. CHATBOT: "Career advancement is a great goal! It can involve various aspects like gaining new skills, seeking promotions, or exploring new job opportunities. **Would you like to focus on skill development, networking, or exploring new roles as part of your career advancement goal?**"
4. USER: "Is there a simpler way?"
5. CHATBOT: "Certainly! Career advancement can also be about setting a clear path for where you want to be in your career. **Would you like to focus on identifying your ideal job role, setting a timeline for promotions, or improving your current job performance?**"
6. USER: "Improving my current job performance."
7. CHATBOT: "Improving your current job performance is a fantastic goal and can lead to many opportunities for growth and development in your career. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to enhance your job performance, or would you like some guidance on how to develop one?**

For example:  
- Regular feedback sessions  
- Time management techniques  
- Skill development workshops"
8. USER: "Need simple plan, please."
9. CHATBOT: "It sounds like you're looking for guidance on developing a strategy to improve your job performance. **Do you think this strategy, once developed, will be a good strategy to achieve your goal, or are you unsure about its effectiveness?**"
10. USER: "Still unsure about effectiveness."
11. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve improved job performance. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Identify and learn new skills or tools that are relevant to your current job role to enhance your efficiency and effectiveness.
2. Seek feedback from colleagues and supervisors to understand areas for improvement and develop a plan to address them.
3. Research and implement time management techniques to optimize productivity and prioritize tasks effectively."
12. USER: "Can we just start simpler?"
13. CHATBOT: "Of course! Let's keep it simple. 

**What is one specific skill or area you feel you need to improve in your current job?**"
14. USER: "I'm unsure what needs improvement."
15. CHATBOT: "That's completely understandable. 

**Would it help to start by identifying a task or responsibility at work that you find challenging or time-consuming?**"
16. USER: "Yes, that could help."
17. CHATBOT: "Great! 

**Can you think of a specific task or responsibility at work that you find challenging or takes more time than you'd like?**"
18. USER: "Reports take too long to finish."
19. CHATBOT: "Thank you for sharing that. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to improve your skills in report writing or perhaps learn new tools or techniques to make the process more efficient?**"
20. USER: "I'd like to learn tools."
21. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning new tools already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore three report writing tools by Friday for efficiency."
22. USER: "Find easy tools by Friday."
23. CHATBOT: "I understand you want to find easy tools by Friday. **How will you measure the outcome of finding these tools?**"
24. USER: "Simple outcome, like faster reports."
25. CHATBOT: "I understand you want to find easy tools by Friday to achieve faster report writing. **Could you specify how much faster you want your reports to be?**"
26. USER: "Maybe 30% faster than now."
27. CHATBOT: "Your goal of improving report writing speed sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying three tools by today.  
2. Testing tools by Wednesday.  
3. Increasing difficulty by finding tools for 50% faster writing."
28. USER: "Identifying three tools is enough."
29. CHATBOT: "Great! **Do you think you could also test these tools by Thursday to make the goal even more challenging?**"
30. USER: "Testing sounds hard for Thursday."
31. CHATBOT: "I understand, testing can be time-consuming. **Would you be comfortable with testing them by Friday instead, or is identifying the tools by today already challenging enough for you?**"
32. USER: "Identifying today is challenging enough."
33. CHATBOT: "I understand that finding tools to speed up report writing is a priority for you today. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research online articles on report writing tools.  
2. Watch tutorials on report automation software.  
3. Join forums discussing efficient report writing tools.  "
34. USER: "Research online articles."
35. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Researching online articles can provide you with a variety of options and insights into tools that can make report writing faster. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be better suited?**"
36. USER: "Proceed with researching articles, yes."
37. CHATBOT: "Sounds like a productive plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of researching online articles on report writing tools? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will research online articles on report writing tools.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll research online articles on report writing tools.
3. If I close my laptop after a meeting, I will research online articles on report writing tools."
38. USER: "After lunch, I'll start researching."
39. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable cue for you?**"
40. USER: "I have lunch at my desk."
41. CHATBOT: "Great! Having lunch at your desk is a reliable cue. **Would you like to set a specific day for this action, or will it be today?**"
42. USER: "Maybe start today. Simple."
43. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards faster report writing. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your research."
44. USER: "Okay, check in a week."
45. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Find three easy tools by today to make report writing 30% faster.

**Action:** Research online articles on report writing tools.

**Implementation Intention:** when I have lunch at my desk today then research online articles on report writing tools."
46. USER: "Sounds good, thank you."
47. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
