            plan, and the chatbot should have focused on providing or suggesting a
            simple plan rather than questioning the effectiveness of a non-existent
            strategy. This leads to a breakdown as it doesn't directly address the
            user's request and can confuse the user about the next steps. The breakdown
            types that apply here are 'Ignore request' because the chatbot doesn't

        writing tools? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant
        event and is very noticeable so you don''t forget it.


        For Example:

        1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will research online articles on
        report writing tools.

        2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I''ll research online articles
        on report writing tools.

        3. If I close my laptop after a meeting, I will research online articles on
        report writing tools.'

    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively efficient, with the chatbot guiding
            the user through the goal-setting process in a logical manner. However,
            there were a few instances where the user expressed a desire for simplicity,
            indicating that the process might have been slightly more complex than
