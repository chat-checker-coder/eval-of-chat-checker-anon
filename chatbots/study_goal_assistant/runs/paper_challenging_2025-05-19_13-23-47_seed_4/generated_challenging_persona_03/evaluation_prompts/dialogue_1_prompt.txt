system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm thinking about a diet... maybe?"
3. Chatbot: "A diet sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your health, losing weight, or increasing energy levels. **Would you still like to keep a diet as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Improving health, I suppose. Convince me."
5. Chatbot: "Improving your health is a wonderful goal that can lead to numerous benefits, such as increased energy, better mood, and a longer, more fulfilling life. It's a journey that can positively impact every aspect of your well-being.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
6. User: "I already exercise, mostly. But diets seem dull."
7. Chatbot: "It's great that you're already exercising! Finding a diet that feels enjoyable rather than dull can make a big difference in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

**Do you think your current exercise routine is a good strategy to achieve your health goal, or are you considering making changes?**"
8. User: "I'm considering changes, maybe."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your health improvement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of physical activities that can enhance overall health and well-being.
2. Learn about balanced nutrition and how to create a meal plan that supports a healthy lifestyle.
3. Study stress management techniques and their impact on physical and mental health."
10. User: "I'll research balanced nutrition plans."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching balanced nutrition plans already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three balanced nutrition plans by Friday."
12. User: "Three? Why not four?"
13. Chatbot: "Four is a great choice! **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans?**"
14. User: "Let's say... next Tuesday?"
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying four plans by today.  
2. Identifying six plans by next Tuesday.  
3. Identifying four plans by this Friday."
16. User: "I'll stick with four plans."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans by next Tuesday is a great step towards better health. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on balanced nutrition.  
2. Consult a nutritionist for expert advice.  
3. Watch 4 webinars on nutrition planning.  "
18. User: "Consult a nutritionist, maybe?"
19. Chatbot: "Consulting a nutritionist is an excellent action to take, as they can provide personalized advice and help you create balanced nutrition plans. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
20. User: "I'll consider books instead."
21. Chatbot: "Reading books on balanced nutrition is a great way to gain knowledge and insights. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you have in mind?**"
22. User: "Webinars instead seem exciting."
23. Chatbot: "Watching webinars on nutrition planning can be both informative and engaging. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to explore?**"
24. User: "I'm considering books again."
25. Chatbot: "Reading books on balanced nutrition is a solid choice for gaining in-depth knowledge. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
26. User: "I'm torn... books or webinars?"
27. Chatbot: "Both books and webinars offer valuable insights, but books provide detailed information, while webinars can offer interactive learning experiences. **Which format do you think will best suit your learning style and schedule?**"
28. User: "Webinars, but books seem thorough."
29. Chatbot: "Webinars can offer a dynamic and interactive way to learn, while books provide comprehensive and detailed information. **Would you like to start with webinars and then explore books for more in-depth knowledge, or do you have another preference?**"
30. User: "Books first, then webinars."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a well-structured plan to gain a thorough understanding of balanced nutrition. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading books first and then watching webinars? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read a book on nutrition.
2. When I sit down for dinner, I'll watch a nutrition webinar for insights.
3. After I finish my morning coffee, I'll research balanced nutrition plans online."
32. User: "After coffee, I'll read."
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great cue! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help ensure the location is clear and consistent for your action."
34. User: "Living room, primary hangout spot."
35. Chatbot: "Great choice! Having your morning coffee in the living room is a consistent and reliable cue. **On which days do you plan to implement this action in the next 7 days?**"
36. User: "I'll do it every day."
37. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards balanced nutrition. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading and watching."
38. User: "Let's see how it goes."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify four balanced nutrition plans by next Tuesday.

**Action:** Read books on balanced nutrition first, then watch webinars for additional insights.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in the living room every day, I'll read books on balanced nutrition first, then watch webinars for additional insights."
40. User: "Seems overly ambitious... yet doable."
41. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
