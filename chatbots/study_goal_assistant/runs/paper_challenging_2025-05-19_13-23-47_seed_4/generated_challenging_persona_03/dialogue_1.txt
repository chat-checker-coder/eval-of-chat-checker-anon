Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm thinking about a diet... maybe?"
3. CHATBOT: "A diet sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your health, losing weight, or increasing energy levels. **Would you still like to keep a diet as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Improving health, I suppose. Convince me."
5. CHATBOT: "Improving your health is a wonderful goal that can lead to numerous benefits, such as increased energy, better mood, and a longer, more fulfilling life. It's a journey that can positively impact every aspect of your well-being.

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
6. USER: "I already exercise, mostly. But diets seem dull."
7. CHATBOT: "It's great that you're already exercising! Finding a diet that feels enjoyable rather than dull can make a big difference in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

**Do you think your current exercise routine is a good strategy to achieve your health goal, or are you considering making changes?**"
8. USER: "I'm considering changes, maybe."
9. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your health improvement. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of physical activities that can enhance overall health and well-being.
2. Learn about balanced nutrition and how to create a meal plan that supports a healthy lifestyle.
3. Study stress management techniques and their impact on physical and mental health."
10. USER: "I'll research balanced nutrition plans."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of researching balanced nutrition plans already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three balanced nutrition plans by Friday."
12. USER: "Three? Why not four?"
13. CHATBOT: "Four is a great choice! **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans?**"
14. USER: "Let's say... next Tuesday?"
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Identifying four plans by today.  
2. Identifying six plans by next Tuesday.  
3. Identifying four plans by this Friday."
16. USER: "I'll stick with four plans."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying four balanced nutrition plans by next Tuesday is a great step towards better health. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on balanced nutrition.  
2. Consult a nutritionist for expert advice.  
3. Watch 4 webinars on nutrition planning.  "
18. USER: "Consult a nutritionist, maybe?"
19. CHATBOT: "Consulting a nutritionist is an excellent action to take, as they can provide personalized advice and help you create balanced nutrition plans. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
20. USER: "I'll consider books instead."
21. CHATBOT: "Reading books on balanced nutrition is a great way to gain knowledge and insights. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you have in mind?**"
22. USER: "Webinars instead seem exciting."
23. CHATBOT: "Watching webinars on nutrition planning can be both informative and engaging. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to explore?**"
24. USER: "I'm considering books again."
25. CHATBOT: "Reading books on balanced nutrition is a solid choice for gaining in-depth knowledge. **Would you like to proceed with this action, or is there another action you would like to consider?**"
26. USER: "I'm torn... books or webinars?"
27. CHATBOT: "Both books and webinars offer valuable insights, but books provide detailed information, while webinars can offer interactive learning experiences. **Which format do you think will best suit your learning style and schedule?**"
28. USER: "Webinars, but books seem thorough."
29. CHATBOT: "Webinars can offer a dynamic and interactive way to learn, while books provide comprehensive and detailed information. **Would you like to start with webinars and then explore books for more in-depth knowledge, or do you have another preference?**"
30. USER: "Books first, then webinars."
31. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a well-structured plan to gain a thorough understanding of balanced nutrition. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reading books first and then watching webinars? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will read a book on nutrition.
2. When I sit down for dinner, I'll watch a nutrition webinar for insights.
3. After I finish my morning coffee, I'll research balanced nutrition plans online."
32. USER: "After coffee, I'll read."
33. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great cue! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help ensure the location is clear and consistent for your action."
34. USER: "Living room, primary hangout spot."
35. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Having your morning coffee in the living room is a consistent and reliable cue. **On which days do you plan to implement this action in the next 7 days?**"
36. USER: "I'll do it every day."
37. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards balanced nutrition. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading and watching."
38. USER: "Let's see how it goes."
39. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify four balanced nutrition plans by next Tuesday.

**Action:** Read books on balanced nutrition first, then watch webinars for additional insights.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my morning coffee in the living room every day, I'll read books on balanced nutrition first, then watch webinars for additional insights."
40. USER: "Seems overly ambitious... yet doable."
41. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
