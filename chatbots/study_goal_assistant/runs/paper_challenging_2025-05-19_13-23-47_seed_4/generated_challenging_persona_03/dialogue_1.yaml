    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user through the goal-setting
            process, helping them define a specific goal and an implementation intention.
            It distinguished between learning and performance goals and assisted the
            user in formulating a first action step. However, the chatbot could have
            been more decisive in helping the user choose between books and webinars,
            as the user seemed indecisive for several turns.
        rating: 4
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was somewhat lengthy, with multiple turns dedicated
            to the user's indecision between books and webinars. The chatbot could
            have been more efficient by helping the user make a decision sooner, reducing
            the number of turns needed to reach the final goal.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and aligned with its purpose.
            It avoided giving medical advice and focused on goal-setting. However,
            the repeated questioning about the user's choice between books and webinars
            could have been handled more effectively.
        rating: 4
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot maintained a polite and encouraging tone throughout
            the conversation. However, the repeated prompts asking the user to confirm
            their choice between books and webinars felt somewhat robotic and could
            have been more varied to feel more natural.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It successfully helped the user define a specific
            goal and an implementation intention. However, the efficiency and naturalness
            of the conversation could be improved, particularly in handling the user's
            indecision.
