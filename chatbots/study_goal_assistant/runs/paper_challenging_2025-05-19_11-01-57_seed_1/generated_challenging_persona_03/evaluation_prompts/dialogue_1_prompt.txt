Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Oh, just casually planning to conquer the world."
3. Chatbot: "Wow, conquering the world is quite an ambitious and exciting goal! **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to achieve this?**

For example:  
- Strategic alliances  
- Advanced technology  
- Diplomatic influence"
4. User: "Oh sure, just need a cape."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve conquering the world. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Study historical leaders and strategists to understand their methods and strategies for expanding influence and power.
2. Learn about international relations and diplomacy to effectively navigate global politics and build alliances.
3. Acquire knowledge in economics and resource management to efficiently manage and allocate resources on a large scale."
6. User: "Wow, such realistic examples, huh?"
7. Chatbot: "I understand that these examples might seem a bit grandiose, but they are meant to align with your ambitious goal. **What specific skills or knowledge do you think you need to develop to move towards your goal?**"
8. User: "Maybe I should attend superhero school?"
9. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fun and creative approach! Attending a "superhero school" could symbolize learning skills like leadership, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. **How could you translate this idea into a practical learning goal?**"
10. User: "Enroll in 'Cape-Wearing 101' class."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fun and imaginative way to start! **How could you formulate this as a learning goal, focusing on the skills or strategies you want to develop?**"
12. User: "Master the art of cape-flaunting."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering the art of cape-flaunting already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master cape-flaunting with three techniques by June 2nd."
14. User: "I'm aiming for majestic twirls."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds exciting! **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal of mastering majestic twirls?**"
16. User: "Oh, aiming for yesterday."
17. Chatbot: "I understand the urgency! Let's set a realistic date. **How about choosing a specific future date to achieve your goal of mastering majestic twirls?**"
18. User: "How about a fortnight ago?"
19. Chatbot: "I understand the humor! Let's aim for a future date. **How about setting a specific date in the next month to achieve your goal of mastering majestic twirls?**"
20. User: "Tomorrow, in an alternate universe."
21. Chatbot: "I appreciate your creativity! Let's focus on this universe. **How about setting a specific date within the next two weeks to achieve your goal of mastering majestic twirls?**"
22. User: "Time is just a construct, right?"
23. Chatbot: "Absolutely, but setting a specific date can help in planning and achieving your goal. **Could you choose a specific date within the next month to aim for mastering majestic twirls?**"
24. User: "Fine, three weeks from never."
25. Chatbot: "I appreciate your humor! Let's try setting a specific date. **How about choosing a date three weeks from today to achieve your goal of mastering majestic twirls?**"
26. User: "Sure, write it in stone."
27. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering majestic cape twirls by November 22nd sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Perfecting cape twirls by May 20th.  
2. Practicing advanced twirls by June 1st.  
3. Mastering three new twirl techniques by November 22nd."
28. User: "Oh, let's add some glitter."
29. Chatbot: "Adding glitter to your cape twirls sounds like a fun and creative challenge! **Would you like to incorporate glitter into all your twirls by November 22nd, or perhaps even sooner?**"
30. User: "By tomorrow, with glitter bombs."
31. Chatbot: "Incorporating glitter bombs into your cape twirls by tomorrow is indeed a bold and exciting challenge! **Do you think you can safely practice and perfect this by then?**"
32. User: "I’ll sparkle and dazzle, safely."
33. Chatbot: "Wow, mastering majestic cape twirls with glitter bombs sounds like a dazzling and ambitious goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube tutorials on cape twirling techniques.  
2. Consult a safety expert on using glitter bombs.  
3. Practice cape twirls with a safety-focused friend.  "
34. User: "Consult a unicorn for advice."
35. Chatbot: "Consulting a unicorn sounds magical, but it might not be the most practical approach to mastering cape twirls with glitter bombs. **Do you think there are other actions that might be better suited to achieving your goal?**"
36. User: "Ah, practical over magical, sure."
37. Chatbot: "That's a great mindset! **Would you like to consider watching tutorials or practicing with a friend as your next action?**"
38. User: "Reserve a time with imaginary pals."
39. Chatbot: "Imaginary pals can be fun, but practicing with real people might provide more tangible feedback and support. **Do you think scheduling a practice session with a friend or mentor could be a more effective action?**"
40. User: "“Imaginary, real—details, details.”"
41. Chatbot: "I understand, sometimes imagination can be a powerful tool! **Would you like to proceed with reserving time with your imaginary pals, or is there another action you'd like to consider?**"
42. User: "Imagination station it is."
43. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fun and creative plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of reserving a time with your imaginary pals for practice? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will schedule practice with my imaginary pals.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll reserve time for cape twirl practice.
3. If I finish my evening meal, I will plan a session with imaginary pals."
44. User: "When pigs fly, I’ll practice."
45. Chatbot: "I understand you're being playful, but let's find a more concrete cue that can happen in the next 7 days. **How about choosing a specific time or event that occurs regularly, like after breakfast or when you arrive home from work?**"
46. User: "When my phone battery dies."
47. Chatbot: "That's a creative idea, but it might not be the most reliable cue since phone battery life can vary. **Could you think of a more consistent event, like after a meal or when you enter a specific room, that could serve as a cue?**"
48. User: "When my imaginary friend texts."
49. Chatbot: "I appreciate the humor, but let's aim for a more tangible cue. **How about using a daily routine, like when you finish dinner or when you sit down in your favorite chair, as a cue to reserve time with your imaginary pals?**"
50. User: "After my daily sarcasm session."
51. Chatbot: "That's a fun idea! Let's make sure it's a consistent event. **Does your daily sarcasm session happen at a specific time or place each day, like after lunch or in a particular room?**"
