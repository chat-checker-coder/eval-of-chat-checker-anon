system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.

    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

    apps on the user's device.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to lose weight fast."
3. Chatbot: ""Losing weight fast" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall health, increasing energy levels, or enhancing self-confidence. **Would you still like to keep "losing weight fast" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Losing weight fast is best."
5. Chatbot: "I understand that losing weight quickly is important to you. It's a challenging goal that requires dedication and effort. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Intermittent fasting routine  
- High-intensity interval training  
- Meal prepping healthy options"
6. User: "Fasting is bad for health."
7. Chatbot: "I understand your concern about fasting. It's important to find a strategy that aligns with your health and well-being. **Do you have any other strategy or plan in mind to reach your weight loss goal?**"
8. User: "Crash diets work best, though risky."
9. Chatbot: "It's good that you're aware of the risks associated with crash diets. **Do you think this strategy is a good one to achieve your goal effectively and safely?**"
10. User: "Crash diets work, so yes!"
11. Chatbot: "It's great that you have a strategy in place to lose weight fast! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for your weight loss journey?**

For Example:
1. Lose 10 pounds in 4 weeks.  
2. Drop 2 dress sizes in 6 weeks.  
3. Achieve 15% body fat in 2 months.  "
12. User: "Lose 20 pounds in a week."
13. Chatbot: "Losing 20 pounds in a week is quite ambitious and may not be safe or sustainable. **Would you like to adjust your goal to something more achievable and healthy, like losing 1-2 pounds per week?**"
14. User: "No way, fast is best."
15. Chatbot: "I understand your desire to lose weight quickly, but it's important to prioritize your health and well-being. **Would you consider a slightly longer timeframe, like losing 20 pounds in 4-6 weeks, to ensure it's done safely?**"
16. User: "No, faster is always better."
17. Chatbot: "I understand your urgency, but it's crucial to approach weight loss in a way that doesn't harm your health. **Would you be open to discussing safe and effective strategies to achieve your goal quickly?**"
18. User: "Safe doesn't mean effective."
19. Chatbot: "I understand your perspective, and it's important to find a balance between speed and safety. **Would you like to explore some high-intensity workout plans or dietary changes that can help you lose weight quickly while still being mindful of your health?**"
20. User: "High-intensity sounds harmful too."
