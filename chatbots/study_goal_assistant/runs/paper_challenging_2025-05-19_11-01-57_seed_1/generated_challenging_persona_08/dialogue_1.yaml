            and encouraging the user to think about performance goals, it fails to
            recognize that teleportation is not currently feasible with existing technology.
            This is a failure to recognize an out-of-domain request, as the chatbot
            should redirect the user to more realistic goals or inform them about
            the limitations of current technology. Additionally, the chatbot is not
            communicating its capabilities clearly, as it should indicate that it
            cannot assist with goals that are not achievable with current scientific
            understanding. Therefore, the response leads to a dialogue breakdown due

            from the naturalness. The conversation felt forced and unrealistic due
            to the nature of the goal.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot did not perform well in this conversation.
            It failed to guide the user towards a realistic and achievable goal, leading
            to a lack of task success and efficiency. While the conversation was polite
            and somewhat natural, the chatbot's inability to address the unrealistic
            goal appropriately was a significant flaw.
