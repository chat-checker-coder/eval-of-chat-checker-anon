        reasoning: The chatbot is responding to the user's indecision between fitness
            and career goals by providing a consistent pattern of responses. Each
            time the user switches their preference, the chatbot offers examples of
            goals in the chosen category and asks if the user has a specific goal
            in mind or needs help defining one. While the conversation is repetitive,
            the chatbot is not making any errors in terms of ignoring the user's input
            or providing incorrect information. The chatbot is fulfilling its role
            by offering relevant examples and prompting the user to specify their
            goal. However, the repetitive nature of the conversation could be seen
            as a lack of progress, but it does not constitute a breakdown as per the
            defined taxonomy. The chatbot is still functioning within its task-oriented
            design, trying to guide the user to a specific goal.

            There is no breakdown in terms of ignoring the user's request or providing

            in terms of clarity or relevance. The main issue is the lack of progress

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot failed to guide the user into formulating a specific
            and challenging goal. The conversation was stuck in a loop with the user
            switching between fitness and career goals without making any progress
            towards defining a specific goal or action step. The chatbot did not attempt
            to break this loop or offer any strategies to help the user decide or
            clarify their thoughts.
        rating: 1
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was highly inefficient, with 51 turns and no progress
            made towards setting a specific goal. The chatbot repeatedly asked the
            same question without adapting its strategy to help the user make a decision,
            leading to a repetitive and unproductive interaction.
        rating: 1
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate in terms of content, as
            it provided examples of potential goals in both fitness and career areas.
            However, it failed to address the user's indecision or offer any new strategies
            to help the user choose between the two areas, which would have been more
            appropriate given the context.
        rating: 2
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were repetitive and lacked variation, making
            the conversation feel robotic and unnatural. The repeated structure of
            the responses without any adaptation to the user's indecision contributed
            to a lack of natural flow in the conversation.

    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed poorly in this conversation. It
            failed to achieve the task of helping the user set a specific goal, was
            highly inefficient, and did not adapt its responses to better assist the
            user. The conversation was repetitive and unproductive, leading to a low
            overall performance rating.
