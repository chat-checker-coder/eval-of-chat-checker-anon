Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to run faster."
3. CHATBOT: "Running faster sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your overall fitness, preparing for a race, or enhancing your athletic performance. **Would you still like to keep running faster as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Yeah, I just want speed."
5. CHATBOT: "Speed is an exciting and challenging goal to pursue! It can be incredibly rewarding to see your progress as you get faster. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you increase your running speed?**

For example:  
- Interval training sessions  
- Strength training exercises  
- Consistent running schedule"
6. USER: "What's a consistent schedule?"
7. CHATBOT: "A consistent running schedule typically involves setting specific days and times each week dedicated to running, ensuring you have a balanced mix of easy runs, long runs, and speed workouts. This helps your body adapt and improve over time. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you increase your running speed?**"
8. USER: "No plan. Need simple steps."
9. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of increasing running speed. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different running techniques and form adjustments that can help improve speed.
2. Learn about interval training and how to incorporate it into your running routine to enhance speed.
3. Study the role of strength training in running and identify exercises that can build the muscles needed for faster running."
10. USER: "Learn running techniques first."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning running techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore three running techniques by May 26, choose one."
12. USER: "What's 'by May 26' mean?"
13. CHATBOT: ""By May 26" means that you aim to achieve your goal on or before the date of May 26. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. USER: "I need more time, maybe."
15. CHATBOT: "That's completely understandable. **When do you think would be a realistic date for you to achieve your goal?**"
16. USER: "August 15, to be sure."
17. CHATBOT: "Great! Now that we have a date, **how could you measure the outcome of your goal to learn running techniques?**"
18. USER: "Track improvements in running form."
19. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning running techniques and tracking improvements sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Learning all techniques by May 26.
2. Tracking improvements weekly until August 15.
3. Increasing difficulty by mastering five techniques."
20. USER: "How do I track weekly?"
21. CHATBOT: "To track weekly, you can maintain a running journal or use a running app to log your runs, noting down the distance, time, and any observations about your form. **Would you like to make your goal more challenging by incorporating weekly tracking and perhaps adding more techniques to master?**"
22. USER: "Weekly tracking sounds complicated."
23. CHATBOT: "I understand that weekly tracking can seem overwhelming. **Would you prefer to keep your goal as it is, or is there another way you might want to make it more challenging without weekly tracking?**"
24. USER: "Keep it simple, please."
25. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a goal to learn running techniques and track your improvements by August 15. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 YouTube videos on running techniques.  
2. Read a book on running form improvement.  
3. Attend a running workshop or seminar.  "
26. USER: "Watch running technique videos."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great action to start with! **Do you want to proceed with watching running technique videos as your action?**"
28. USER: "Yes, I'll start there."
29. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching running technique videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will watch a running technique video.
2. When I lace up my running shoes, I'll watch a running technique video.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will watch a running technique video."
30. USER: "If I finish dinner, I'll watch."
31. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you?**"
32. USER: "I eat dinner in the kitchen."
33. CHATBOT: "Great! Having dinner in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to implement this?**"
34. USER: "Every day if I can."
35. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards improving your running form. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on watching those videos."
36. USER: "Why check in? I'll remember."
37. CHATBOT: "Checking in can provide a gentle reminder and support to help you stay on track with your goals. It can also be an opportunity to discuss any challenges you might face and celebrate your progress. However, if you prefer not to have a check-in, that's perfectly fine too! Would you like to proceed with a check-in, or would you rather not?"
38. USER: "I'd rather not, thanks."
39. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Learn three running techniques and track improvements in running form by August 15.

**Action:** Watch running technique videos

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish dinner in the kitchen, I'll watch running technique videos"
40. USER: "Okay, recap looks good."
