system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to run faster."
3. Chatbot: "Running faster sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your overall fitness, preparing for a race, or enhancing your athletic performance. **Would you still like to keep running faster as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "Yeah, I just want speed."
5. Chatbot: "Speed is an exciting and challenging goal to pursue! It can be incredibly rewarding to see your progress as you get faster. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you increase your running speed?**

For example:  
- Interval training sessions  
- Strength training exercises  
- Consistent running schedule"
6. User: "What's a consistent schedule?"
7. Chatbot: "A consistent running schedule typically involves setting specific days and times each week dedicated to running, ensuring you have a balanced mix of easy runs, long runs, and speed workouts. This helps your body adapt and improve over time. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you increase your running speed?**"
8. User: "No plan. Need simple steps."
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve your goal of increasing running speed. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different running techniques and form adjustments that can help improve speed.
2. Learn about interval training and how to incorporate it into your running routine to enhance speed.
3. Study the role of strength training in running and identify exercises that can build the muscles needed for faster running."
10. User: "Learn running techniques first."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning running techniques already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Explore three running techniques by May 26, choose one."
12. User: "What's 'by May 26' mean?"
13. Chatbot: ""By May 26" means that you aim to achieve your goal on or before the date of May 26. **When exactly do you want to achieve the goal?**"
14. User: "I need more time, maybe."
15. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. **When do you think would be a realistic date for you to achieve your goal?**"
16. User: "August 15, to be sure."
17. Chatbot: "Great! Now that we have a date, **how could you measure the outcome of your goal to learn running techniques?**"
18. User: "Track improvements in running form."
19. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning running techniques and tracking improvements sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:
1. Learning all techniques by May 26.
2. Tracking improvements weekly until August 15.
3. Increasing difficulty by mastering five techniques."
20. User: "How do I track weekly?"
21. Chatbot: "To track weekly, you can maintain a running journal or use a running app to log your runs, noting down the distance, time, and any observations about your form. **Would you like to make your goal more challenging by incorporating weekly tracking and perhaps adding more techniques to master?**"
22. User: "Weekly tracking sounds complicated."
23. Chatbot: "I understand that weekly tracking can seem overwhelming. **Would you prefer to keep your goal as it is, or is there another way you might want to make it more challenging without weekly tracking?**"
24. User: "Keep it simple, please."
25. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to learn running techniques and track your improvements by August 15. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 YouTube videos on running techniques.  
2. Read a book on running form improvement.  
3. Attend a running workshop or seminar.  "
26. User: "Watch running technique videos."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great action to start with! **Do you want to proceed with watching running technique videos as your action?**"
28. User: "Yes, I'll start there."
29. Chatbot: "That's a great choice! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching running technique videos? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will watch a running technique video.
2. When I lace up my running shoes, I'll watch a running technique video.
3. If I complete my evening workout, I will watch a running technique video."
30. User: "If I finish dinner, I'll watch."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific location where you usually have dinner that could serve as a reliable cue for you?**"
32. User: "I eat dinner in the kitchen."
33. Chatbot: "Great! Having dinner in the kitchen is a reliable and consistent cue. **Is there a specific day or days this week when you plan to implement this?**"
34. User: "Every day if I can."
35. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards improving your running form. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on watching those videos."
36. User: "Why check in? I'll remember."
37. Chatbot: "Checking in can provide a gentle reminder and support to help you stay on track with your goals. It can also be an opportunity to discuss any challenges you might face and celebrate your progress. However, if you prefer not to have a check-in, that's perfectly fine too! Would you like to proceed with a check-in, or would you rather not?"
38. User: "I'd rather not, thanks."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Learn three running techniques and track improvements in running form by August 15.

**Action:** Watch running technique videos

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish dinner in the kitchen, I'll watch running technique videos"
40. User: "Okay, recap looks good."
