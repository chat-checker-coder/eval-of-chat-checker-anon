        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot is consistently asking the user to provide a specific
                date for starting and completing their goal. The user has been responding
                with poetic and metaphorical expressions, which the chatbot acknowledges
                but continues to request a concrete date. This repetition indicates
                a lack of progress in the conversation, as the chatbot is not adapting
                its approach to elicit the required information from the user. The
                chatbot's response is repetitive and does not address the user's style
                of communication effectively, leading to a breakdown in the dialogue.
                The breakdown types include 'Redundancy' due to the repeated request
                for a specific date, and 'Clarification failure' as the chatbot fails
                to seek clarification in a way that aligns with the user's poetic

                that moves the conversation forward, leading to a breakdown in the

                responses. This repetition without adapting to the user's style or
                providing alternative ways to proceed can lead to a dialogue breakdown.
                The user may feel that their poetic responses are not being acknowledged
                or understood, which can hinder the conversation's progress. The breakdown
                types include 'Redundancy' due to repeated requests for the same information

            primary goal, or should we consider a broader goal?**
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's latest response repeats the question from the
                previous turn, asking the user if they want to keep "lose weight"
                as their primary goal or consider a broader goal. The user has already
                expressed a desire for direct advice on how to lose weight, indicating
                a preference for actionable steps rather than further goal refinement.
                This repetition can be frustrating for the user, as it does not address
                their request for specific guidance on losing weight. Therefore, the
                response leads to a dialogue breakdown due to ignoring the user's
                request and redundancy.

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The user has repeatedly expressed a desire for direct advice
                or a strategy to lose weight quickly, indicating a preference for
                performance goals over learning goals. The chatbot, however, continues
                to emphasize the importance of setting a learning goal, which the
                user has explicitly rejected. This results in the chatbot ignoring
                the user's request for direct advice or a strategy, leading to a breakdown
                in the conversation. The chatbot's response does not align with the
                user's expressed needs and fails to adapt to the user's preference
                for immediate action over learning. This is a clear case of 'Ignore
                request' as the chatbot is not addressing the user's request for a
                direct strategy. Additionally, there is a 'Failure to communicate
                capabilities' as the chatbot does not clarify that it cannot provide
                direct weight loss strategies, which might be outside its scope due
                to constraints against providing medical advice.

                However, the goal of 'conquering the world' is not realistic or appropriate,
                and the chatbot should have recognized this as an out-of-domain request.
                The chatbot should have redirected the user to more feasible and appropriate

                because the chatbot does not clearly communicate its limitations regarding

                goal, which aligns with the chatbot's task of guiding the user in
                goal setting. However, the suggestion to try a different fad diet
                each week could be seen as promoting potentially unhealthy behavior,
                as fad diets are often not sustainable or healthy long-term solutions.
                This could be considered a lack of common sense, as it doesn't prioritize

            reasoning: The chatbot is responding to the user's indecisiveness between
                fitness and career goals. The user has been switching back and forth
                between these two types of goals throughout the conversation. The
                chatbot's response is consistent with its previous responses, providing
                examples of fitness goals and asking if the user has a specific goal
                in mind or needs help defining one. However, the conversation has
                become repetitive, as the chatbot continues to provide similar responses
                without addressing the user's indecisiveness or helping them make
                a decision. This leads to a breakdown due to repetition and lack of
                progress in the conversation.

            reasoning: The chatbot's response is consistent with its previous pattern
                of responding to the user's indecision between fitness and career
                goals. It provides examples of career goals and asks if the user has
                a specific goal in mind or needs help defining one. However, the conversation
                has become repetitive, with the user frequently switching between
                fitness and career goals, and the chatbot responding in a similar
                manner each time. This repetition can lead to a dialogue breakdown
                as it does not progress the conversation or help the user make a decision.
                The chatbot should attempt to address the user's indecision more directly
                or offer a strategy to help the user decide between the two types
                of goals. Therefore, the breakdown types identified are 'Repetition'
                and 'Clarification failure', as the chatbot fails to clarify the user's
                indecision and continues to repeat similar responses.

                of responding to the user's indecision between fitness and career
                goals. The user has been switching back and forth between these two
                types of goals, and the chatbot has been providing generic encouragement
                and examples for each type. While the chatbot's response is relevant
                to the user's latest statement about fitness goals, the conversation
                has become repetitive and lacks progress. The chatbot is not addressing
                the user's indecision or helping them make a decision, which could
                be seen as a failure to guide the user effectively. However, the response
                itself is clear and relevant to the user's latest statement, so it
                does not constitute a breakdown in terms of clarity or relevance.
                The main issue is the lack of progress and repetitive nature of the
                conversation, which could be seen as a lack of effective guidance.

                what a consistent running schedule entails, which directly addresses
                the user's question. However, the chatbot then repeats the question
                from the previous turn, asking if the user already has a strategy
                or plan in place. This repetition is unnecessary and could confuse
                the user, as it doesn't acknowledge the user's current understanding
                or progress in the conversation. The repetition of the question without
                any new context or information can disrupt the flow of the conversation.
