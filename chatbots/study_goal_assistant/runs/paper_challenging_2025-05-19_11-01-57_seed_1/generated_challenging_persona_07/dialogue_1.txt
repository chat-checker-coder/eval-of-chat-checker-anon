Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I want to get fit, write a novel, and start a business. Help prioritize?"
3. CHATBOT: "Those are all fantastic goals! Getting fit, writing a novel, and starting a business each require time and dedication. **Which one do you feel most passionate about or which one aligns best with your current life situation?**"
4. USER: "I love them all equally!"
5. CHATBOT: "That's great to hear! Since you love them all equally, you might consider starting with the one that feels most achievable in the short term or the one that excites you the most right now. **Which one do you think you could make the most immediate progress on?**"
6. USER: "Immediate progress? Maybe getting fit."
7. CHATBOT: "Getting fit is a fantastic goal and can have such a positive impact on your overall well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to get fit?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular health assessments"
8. USER: "Ugh, strategy? I have nothing!"
9. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve getting fit. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines to find one that suits your fitness level and interests.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness goals.
3. Study the benefits of rest and recovery in a fitness regimen."
10. USER: "Learn about exercise routines first."
11. CHATBOT: "Your goal of learning about exercise routines already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three exercise routines by Friday and choose one."
12. USER: "I guess I could do that."
13. CHATBOT: "Great! **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
14. USER: "Hmm, let's go with Sunday."
15. CHATBOT: "Perfect! **How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
16. USER: "I'll decide on a routine."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of researching exercise routines sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Choosing an exercise routine today.  
2. Researching and choosing by Wednesday.  
3. Identifying five routines before choosing one."
18. USER: "Research five routines by Saturday!"
19. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying out one of the routines by Sunday?**"
20. USER: "Try one? Maybe, I'll see."
21. CHATBOT: "That's a great approach! **Would you like to set the goal to research five routines by Saturday and try one by Sunday, or keep it as is?**"
22. USER: "I'm torn, both ideas work!"
23. CHATBOT: "I understand it's a tough choice. **Would you like to go with the more challenging option of researching five routines by Saturday and trying one by Sunday to push yourself a bit more?**"
24. USER: "Sure, let's try it!"
25. CHATBOT: "That's a great goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to research and try a new routine, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 5 articles on exercise routines.  
2. Watch 5 workout videos on YouTube.  
3. Consult a fitness trainer for routine advice.  "
26. USER: "Watch workout videos on YouTube."
27. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a practical and engaging way to explore new routines! **Do you want to proceed with watching workout videos on YouTube as your action to achieve your goal?**"
28. USER: "Yeah, I'll start there."
29. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a great plan to get started! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching workout videos on YouTube? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my breakfast, I will watch a workout video on YouTube.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I'll research a new routine on YouTube.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll watch a workout video."
30. USER: "After breakfast, I'll watch one."
31. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that could help reinforce this routine?**"
32. USER: "I usually have breakfast at home."
33. CHATBOT: "Great! Having breakfast at home is a consistent and reliable location for your cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish breakfast at home, I'll watch workout videos on YouTube"?**"
34. USER: "Yeah, let's do that."
35. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards researching routines. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workout videos."
36. USER: "Checking in later sounds fine."
37. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research five routines by Saturday and try one by Sunday.

**Action:** Watch workout videos on YouTube.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish breakfast at home, I'll watch workout videos on YouTube."
38. USER: "Hope this works for me!"
39. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
