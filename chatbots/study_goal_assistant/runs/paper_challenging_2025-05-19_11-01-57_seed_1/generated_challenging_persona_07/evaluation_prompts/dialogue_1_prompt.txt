system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I want to get fit, write a novel, and start a business. Help prioritize?"
3. Chatbot: "Those are all fantastic goals! Getting fit, writing a novel, and starting a business each require time and dedication. **Which one do you feel most passionate about or which one aligns best with your current life situation?**"
4. User: "I love them all equally!"
5. Chatbot: "That's great to hear! Since you love them all equally, you might consider starting with the one that feels most achievable in the short term or the one that excites you the most right now. **Which one do you think you could make the most immediate progress on?**"
6. User: "Immediate progress? Maybe getting fit."
7. Chatbot: "Getting fit is a fantastic goal and can have such a positive impact on your overall well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for how you want to get fit?**

For example:  
- Consistent workout schedule  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular health assessments"
8. User: "Ugh, strategy? I have nothing!"
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve getting fit. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercise routines to find one that suits your fitness level and interests.
2. Learn about proper nutrition and how it supports fitness goals.
3. Study the benefits of rest and recovery in a fitness regimen."
10. User: "Learn about exercise routines first."
11. Chatbot: "Your goal of learning about exercise routines already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Research three exercise routines by Friday and choose one."
12. User: "I guess I could do that."
13. Chatbot: "Great! **When exactly do you want to achieve this goal?**"
14. User: "Hmm, let's go with Sunday."
15. Chatbot: "Perfect! **How will you measure the outcome of your goal?**"
16. User: "I'll decide on a routine."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of researching exercise routines sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Choosing an exercise routine today.  
2. Researching and choosing by Wednesday.  
3. Identifying five routines before choosing one."
18. User: "Research five routines by Saturday!"
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying out one of the routines by Sunday?**"
20. User: "Try one? Maybe, I'll see."
21. Chatbot: "That's a great approach! **Would you like to set the goal to research five routines by Saturday and try one by Sunday, or keep it as is?**"
22. User: "I'm torn, both ideas work!"
23. Chatbot: "I understand it's a tough choice. **Would you like to go with the more challenging option of researching five routines by Saturday and trying one by Sunday to push yourself a bit more?**"
24. User: "Sure, let's try it!"
25. Chatbot: "That's a great goal you've set for yourself! Now that I know you want to research and try a new routine, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 5 articles on exercise routines.  
2. Watch 5 workout videos on YouTube.  
3. Consult a fitness trainer for routine advice.  "
26. User: "Watch workout videos on YouTube."
27. Chatbot: "That sounds like a practical and engaging way to explore new routines! **Do you want to proceed with watching workout videos on YouTube as your action to achieve your goal?**"
28. User: "Yeah, I'll start there."
29. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan to get started! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching workout videos on YouTube? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my breakfast, I will watch a workout video on YouTube.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I'll research a new routine on YouTube.
3. If I sit down at my desk after lunch, I'll watch a workout video."
30. User: "After breakfast, I'll watch one."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have breakfast that could help reinforce this routine?**"
32. User: "I usually have breakfast at home."
33. Chatbot: "Great! Having breakfast at home is a consistent and reliable location for your cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish breakfast at home, I'll watch workout videos on YouTube"?**"
34. User: "Yeah, let's do that."
35. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards researching routines. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your workout videos."
36. User: "Checking in later sounds fine."
37. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Research five routines by Saturday and try one by Sunday.

**Action:** Watch workout videos on YouTube.

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish breakfast at home, I'll watch workout videos on YouTube."
38. User: "Hope this works for me!"
39. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
