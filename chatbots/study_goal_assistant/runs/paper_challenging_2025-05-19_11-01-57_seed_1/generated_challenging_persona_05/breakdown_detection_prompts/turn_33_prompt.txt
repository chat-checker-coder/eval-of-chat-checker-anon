system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:

    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Why set goals? Feels pointless."
3. Chatbot: "I understand that it can feel overwhelming or pointless at times. Setting goals can provide direction, motivation, and a sense of accomplishment as you work towards something meaningful. **Is there anything specific you're struggling with right now that we could turn into a goal?**"
4. User: "Meh, just lack motivation. *yawn*"
5. Chatbot: "I get that, motivation can be tough to find sometimes. Maybe starting with a small, achievable goal could help spark some motivation. **Is there something small you'd like to accomplish or improve in your life right now?**"
6. User: "Small? Like brushing daily?"
7. Chatbot: "Brushing daily sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving dental health, establishing a daily routine, or enhancing personal hygiene. **Would you still like to keep brushing daily as your primary goal? If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal.**"
8. User: "Brushing is boring. *sigh*"
9. Chatbot: "I understand, it can feel mundane. Maybe focusing on a broader goal like improving overall health or creating a more engaging daily routine could be more motivating. **Would you like to explore a goal related to health, routine, or something else entirely?**"
10. User: "Eh, health... *yawn* What's the point?"
11. Chatbot: "I understand it might feel challenging to see the point right now, but focusing on health can lead to more energy, better mood, and a longer, more fulfilling life. **Is there a small health-related change you'd be open to exploring, like trying a new activity or improving sleep?**"
12. User: "Hmm, maybe better sleep..."
13. Chatbot: "Improving your sleep is a wonderful goal! Quality sleep can have a significant impact on your overall well-being, including your energy levels and mood. 

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to enhance your sleep quality?**

For example:  
- Consistent bedtime routine  
- Limit screen time before bed  
- Practice relaxation techniques"
14. User: "Strategies? Nah, sounds hard."
15. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve better sleep. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement a bedtime routine that promotes relaxation and better sleep quality.
2. Learn about the impact of diet and exercise on sleep and incorporate beneficial changes into your daily habits.
3. Study different sleep environments and make adjustments to your bedroom to optimize it for restful sleep."
16. User: "Learning seems exhausting. *yawn*"
17. Chatbot: "I understand that it can feel overwhelming, especially when you're tired. Learning can be a gradual process, and even small steps can make a big difference.

**What is one small thing you could learn or try that might help improve your sleep?**"
18. User: "Dunno, maybe skip late screens?"
19. Chatbot: "That's a great start! Reducing screen time before bed can significantly improve sleep quality.

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore more about how screen time affects sleep and find strategies to reduce it?**"
20. User: "Uh, I guess it can't hurt."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring how screen time affects sleep already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three strategies to reduce screen time by Friday."
22. User: "Three by Friday, sure."
23. Chatbot: "Your goal of reducing screen time sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying all three strategies today.  
2. Choosing and implementing one strategy by Wednesday.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
24. User: "Implement one by Wednesday... *shrug*"
25. Chatbot: "I understand that implementing one strategy by Wednesday might feel a bit rushed. **Would you be open to identifying five strategies instead of three by Friday to make it more challenging?**"
26. User: "Five strategies? Sounds tedious."
27. Chatbot: "I understand that identifying five strategies might seem overwhelming. **Would you be comfortable with identifying four strategies by Friday instead?**"
28. User: "Meh, four's still too much."
29. Chatbot: "I understand, let's stick with your original goal of identifying three strategies by Friday. **Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add to your goal?**"
30. User: "Nope, that's enough. *yawn*"
31. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify strategies to reduce screen time by Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on screen time reduction strategies.  
2. Watch TED Talks on digital detox methods.  
3. Listen to podcasts about managing screen time effectively."
32. User: "Probably read an article..."

33. Chatbot: "Reading an article is a great way to start learning about strategies to reduce screen time. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
