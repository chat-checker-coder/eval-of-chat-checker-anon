        that could serve as a cue for reading the article?**
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is relevant and follows logically
            from the user's previous response. The user mentioned using the event
            of finishing their morning coffee as a cue to read an article on screen
            time reduction. The chatbot acknowledges this choice and asks a follow-up
            question about the location, which is a reasonable next step in helping
            the user establish a clear implementation intention. The chatbot's response
            is clear, relevant, and maintains the flow of the conversation without
            any breakdowns. There are no errors or issues in the chatbot's response

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is appropriate and aligns with its
            role as a goal-setting assistant. It acknowledges the user's decision
            to start reading an article after having coffee on the couch and suggests
            a follow-up to check on the user's progress. This is a logical continuation
            of the conversation and supports the user's goal-setting process. The
            chatbot's suggestion to check in a week is relevant and encourages accountability,
            which is beneficial for goal achievement. There are no breakdowns in terms
            of ignoring the user's input, providing wrong information, or failing
            to communicate effectively. The conversation flows smoothly, and the chatbot's
            response is clear and supportive.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user to set a specific goal
            and an implementation intention, which aligns with its task of helping
            users formulate goals. Despite the user's initial reluctance and lack
            of motivation, the chatbot managed to engage the user in setting a goal
            related to reducing screen time and establishing a specific action plan.
        rating: 5
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was somewhat lengthy, with the user expressing
            disinterest and reluctance multiple times. However, the chatbot remained
            patient and persistent, eventually guiding the user to set a goal. The
            number of turns was higher than ideal, but given the user's resistance,
            the chatbot handled it as efficiently as possible.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot maintained an appropriate tone throughout the conversation,
            showing understanding and empathy towards the user's lack of motivation.
            It avoided giving medical advice and stayed within its capabilities, focusing
            on goal setting and motivation.
        rating: 5
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural and empathetic,
            though at times it felt slightly repetitive in its attempts to engage
            the user. The language was clear and supportive, but the repeated attempts
            to make the goal more challenging could have been more varied in phrasing.
        rating: 4
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user to set
            a goal and an action plan, despite the user's initial reluctance. It maintained
            an appropriate and supportive tone, though the efficiency could have been
            improved with fewer turns. The chatbot fulfilled its task-oriented purpose
            effectively.
