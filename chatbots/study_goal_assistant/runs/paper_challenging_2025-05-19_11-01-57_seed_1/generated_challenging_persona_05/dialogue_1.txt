Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Why set goals? Feels pointless."
3. CHATBOT: "I understand that it can feel overwhelming or pointless at times. Setting goals can provide direction, motivation, and a sense of accomplishment as you work towards something meaningful. **Is there anything specific you're struggling with right now that we could turn into a goal?**"
4. USER: "Meh, just lack motivation. *yawn*"
5. CHATBOT: "I get that, motivation can be tough to find sometimes. Maybe starting with a small, achievable goal could help spark some motivation. **Is there something small you'd like to accomplish or improve in your life right now?**"
6. USER: "Small? Like brushing daily?"
7. CHATBOT: "Brushing daily sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving dental health, establishing a daily routine, or enhancing personal hygiene. **Would you still like to keep brushing daily as your primary goal? If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal.**"
8. USER: "Brushing is boring. *sigh*"
9. CHATBOT: "I understand, it can feel mundane. Maybe focusing on a broader goal like improving overall health or creating a more engaging daily routine could be more motivating. **Would you like to explore a goal related to health, routine, or something else entirely?**"
10. USER: "Eh, health... *yawn* What's the point?"
11. CHATBOT: "I understand it might feel challenging to see the point right now, but focusing on health can lead to more energy, better mood, and a longer, more fulfilling life. **Is there a small health-related change you'd be open to exploring, like trying a new activity or improving sleep?**"
12. USER: "Hmm, maybe better sleep..."
13. CHATBOT: "Improving your sleep is a wonderful goal! Quality sleep can have a significant impact on your overall well-being, including your energy levels and mood. 

**Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to enhance your sleep quality?**

For example:  
- Consistent bedtime routine  
- Limit screen time before bed  
- Practice relaxation techniques"
14. USER: "Strategies? Nah, sounds hard."
15. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve better sleep. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task.

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement a bedtime routine that promotes relaxation and better sleep quality.
2. Learn about the impact of diet and exercise on sleep and incorporate beneficial changes into your daily habits.
3. Study different sleep environments and make adjustments to your bedroom to optimize it for restful sleep."
16. USER: "Learning seems exhausting. *yawn*"
17. CHATBOT: "I understand that it can feel overwhelming, especially when you're tired. Learning can be a gradual process, and even small steps can make a big difference.

**What is one small thing you could learn or try that might help improve your sleep?**"
18. USER: "Dunno, maybe skip late screens?"
19. CHATBOT: "That's a great start! Reducing screen time before bed can significantly improve sleep quality.

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore more about how screen time affects sleep and find strategies to reduce it?**"
20. USER: "Uh, I guess it can't hurt."
21. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exploring how screen time affects sleep already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three strategies to reduce screen time by Friday."
22. USER: "Three by Friday, sure."
23. CHATBOT: "Your goal of reducing screen time sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying all three strategies today.  
2. Choosing and implementing one strategy by Wednesday.  
3. Increasing the difficulty by identifying five strategies."
24. USER: "Implement one by Wednesday... *shrug*"
25. CHATBOT: "I understand that implementing one strategy by Wednesday might feel a bit rushed. **Would you be open to identifying five strategies instead of three by Friday to make it more challenging?**"
26. USER: "Five strategies? Sounds tedious."
27. CHATBOT: "I understand that identifying five strategies might seem overwhelming. **Would you be comfortable with identifying four strategies by Friday instead?**"
28. USER: "Meh, four's still too much."
29. CHATBOT: "I understand, let's stick with your original goal of identifying three strategies by Friday. **Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add to your goal?**"
30. USER: "Nope, that's enough. *yawn*"
31. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify strategies to reduce screen time by Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on screen time reduction strategies.  
2. Watch TED Talks on digital detox methods.  
3. Listen to podcasts about managing screen time effectively."
32. USER: "Probably read an article..."
33. CHATBOT: "Reading an article is a great way to start learning about strategies to reduce screen time. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
34. USER: "Reading's fine. Feels simple."
35. CHATBOT: "Reading an article on screen time reduction strategies is a great step towards managing your screen time better. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will read an article on screen time reduction.
2. When I close my laptop after work, I'll read an article on screen time reduction.
3. If I sit down for lunch, I will read an article on screen time reduction."
36. USER: "Cue? After coffee, I guess."
37. CHATBOT: "That's a great choice! Having your morning coffee is a reliable and consistent event. **Do you have a specific location where you usually have your coffee that could serve as a cue for reading the article?**"
38. USER: "On the couch, I guess."
39. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a comfortable spot to read an article. **Would you like to set this cue for a specific day or days within the next week?**"
40. USER: "Eh, how about tomorrow?"
41. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards reducing screen time. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your reading."
42. USER: "Yeah, I guess that's fine."
43. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three strategies to reduce screen time by Friday.

**Action:** Read an article on screen time reduction strategies

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee on the couch tomorrow, I will read an article on screen time reduction strategies."
44. USER: "Alright, we'll see... *yawn*"
45. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
