Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "Uh, fitness I think? Maybe... more exercises, but not sure which ones?"
3. CHATBOT: ""More exercises" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall fitness, building muscle strength, or increasing endurance. **Would you still like to keep "more exercises" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "I just want to do stuff."
5. CHATBOT: ""Doing stuff" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your physical health, increasing your energy levels, or developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you still like to keep "doing stuff" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
6. USER: "Energy, I think? Or maybe consistency?"
7. CHATBOT: "Improving your energy levels or developing consistency are both fantastic goals that can have a positive impact on many areas of your life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured workout plan  
- Set specific, achievable goals  
- Track progress with a fitness app"
8. USER: "Uh, I don't have one?"
9. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve increased energy and a consistent exercise routine. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercises and their benefits to determine which ones align with your energy-boosting goals.
   
2. Learn about the role of nutrition and hydration in maintaining energy levels and supporting a consistent exercise routine.

3. Study time management techniques to effectively incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule."
10. USER: "Time management maybe? But, confused."
11. CHATBOT: "Time management is a great area to focus on for developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore time management techniques that can help you incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule?**"
12. USER: "Uh, not sure. Maybe?"
13. CHATBOT: "No worries, it's okay to feel unsure. **Would you like to explore different time management strategies to see which ones might work best for you in fitting exercise into your routine?**"
14. USER: "Explore strategies? Like which ones?"
15. CHATBOT: "You could explore strategies like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, or setting specific time slots for exercise in your calendar. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore these time management strategies to help you with your exercise routine?**"
16. USER: "Um, maybe Pomodoro? Sounds fun."
17. CHATBOT: "Your goal of exploring the Pomodoro Technique already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday."
18. USER: "Three strategies? By Friday, huh?"
19. CHATBOT: "Yes, identifying three strategies by a specific day like Friday can make your goal more concrete. **Would you like to set this as your specific goal, or do you have another day in mind?**"
20. USER: "Uh, Friday seems okay."
21. CHATBOT: "Your goal of identifying three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies today.  
2. Choosing a strategy by Wednesday.  
3. Identifying five strategies by Friday."
22. USER: "Three seems hard now."
23. CHATBOT: "I understand, and it's important to set a goal that feels achievable. **Would you like to stick with identifying three strategies by Friday, or perhaps adjust it to two strategies to make it more manageable?**"
24. USER: "Two strategies by Friday, maybe."
25. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a more manageable goal. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the strategies by Friday as well?**"
26. USER: "Implement? By Friday? Um, confused."
27. CHATBOT: "I apologize for the confusion. I meant trying out one of the strategies you identify by Friday. **Would you like to keep the goal as identifying two strategies by Friday, or try one of them as well?**"
28. USER: "Just identify two strategies."
29. CHATBOT: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify two Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on Pomodoro exercise strategies.  
2. Watch videos on Pomodoro workout techniques.  
3. Listen to podcasts about Pomodoro fitness methods.  "
30. USER: "Podcasts maybe? But distracted."
31. CHATBOT: "Listening to podcasts is a great way to learn while multitasking. **Do you think listening to a podcast about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task could help you stay focused?**"
32. USER: "Uh, maybe. I'll try."
33. CHATBOT: "That's a great idea! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of listening to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my morning coffee, I'll listen to a Pomodoro exercise podcast.
2. When I begin my lunch break, I'll play a podcast on Pomodoro strategies.
3. If I start my evening walk, I'll tune into a Pomodoro exercise podcast."
34. USER: "Um, after lunch maybe?"
35. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
36. USER: "Usually at my desk."
37. CHATBOT: "Great! **Would you like to set the cue as "When I finish lunch at my desk, I'll listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task"?** This way, it's tied to a specific location and event."
38. USER: "Sure, that sounds okay."
39. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your podcast listening."
40. USER: "I guess that's fine!"
41. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify two Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday.

**Action:** Listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish lunch at my desk then listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task"
42. USER: "Wait, we're done? Oh, okay."
43. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
