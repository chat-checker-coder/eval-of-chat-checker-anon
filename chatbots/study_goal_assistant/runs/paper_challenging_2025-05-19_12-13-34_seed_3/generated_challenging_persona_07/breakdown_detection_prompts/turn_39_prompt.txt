system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

## Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Uh, fitness I think? Maybe... more exercises, but not sure which ones?"
3. Chatbot: ""More exercises" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall fitness, building muscle strength, or increasing endurance. **Would you still like to keep "more exercises" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I just want to do stuff."
5. Chatbot: ""Doing stuff" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your physical health, increasing your energy levels, or developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you still like to keep "doing stuff" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
6. User: "Energy, I think? Or maybe consistency?"
7. Chatbot: "Improving your energy levels or developing consistency are both fantastic goals that can have a positive impact on many areas of your life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured workout plan  
- Set specific, achievable goals  
- Track progress with a fitness app"
8. User: "Uh, I don't have one?"
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve increased energy and a consistent exercise routine. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercises and their benefits to determine which ones align with your energy-boosting goals.
   
2. Learn about the role of nutrition and hydration in maintaining energy levels and supporting a consistent exercise routine.

3. Study time management techniques to effectively incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule."
10. User: "Time management maybe? But, confused."
11. Chatbot: "Time management is a great area to focus on for developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore time management techniques that can help you incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule?**"
12. User: "Uh, not sure. Maybe?"
13. Chatbot: "No worries, it's okay to feel unsure. **Would you like to explore different time management strategies to see which ones might work best for you in fitting exercise into your routine?**"
14. User: "Explore strategies? Like which ones?"
15. Chatbot: "You could explore strategies like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, or setting specific time slots for exercise in your calendar. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore these time management strategies to help you with your exercise routine?**"
16. User: "Um, maybe Pomodoro? Sounds fun."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring the Pomodoro Technique already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday."
18. User: "Three strategies? By Friday, huh?"
19. Chatbot: "Yes, identifying three strategies by a specific day like Friday can make your goal more concrete. **Would you like to set this as your specific goal, or do you have another day in mind?**"
20. User: "Uh, Friday seems okay."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies today.  
2. Choosing a strategy by Wednesday.  
3. Identifying five strategies by Friday."
22. User: "Three seems hard now."
23. Chatbot: "I understand, and it's important to set a goal that feels achievable. **Would you like to stick with identifying three strategies by Friday, or perhaps adjust it to two strategies to make it more manageable?**"
24. User: "Two strategies by Friday, maybe."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a more manageable goal. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the strategies by Friday as well?**"
26. User: "Implement? By Friday? Um, confused."
27. Chatbot: "I apologize for the confusion. I meant trying out one of the strategies you identify by Friday. **Would you like to keep the goal as identifying two strategies by Friday, or try one of them as well?**"
28. User: "Just identify two strategies."
29. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify two Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on Pomodoro exercise strategies.  
2. Watch videos on Pomodoro workout techniques.  
3. Listen to podcasts about Pomodoro fitness methods.  "
30. User: "Podcasts maybe? But distracted."
31. Chatbot: "Listening to podcasts is a great way to learn while multitasking. **Do you think listening to a podcast about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task could help you stay focused?**"
32. User: "Uh, maybe. I'll try."
33. Chatbot: "That's a great idea! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of listening to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my morning coffee, I'll listen to a Pomodoro exercise podcast.
2. When I begin my lunch break, I'll play a podcast on Pomodoro strategies.
3. If I start my evening walk, I'll tune into a Pomodoro exercise podcast."
34. User: "Um, after lunch maybe?"
35. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
36. User: "Usually at my desk."
37. Chatbot: "Great! **Would you like to set the cue as "When I finish lunch at my desk, I'll listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task"?** This way, it's tied to a specific location and event."
38. User: "Sure, that sounds okay."

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your podcast listening."
