system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Uh, fitness I think? Maybe... more exercises, but not sure which ones?"
3. Chatbot: ""More exercises" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving overall fitness, building muscle strength, or increasing endurance. **Would you still like to keep "more exercises" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. User: "I just want to do stuff."
5. Chatbot: ""Doing stuff" sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as improving your physical health, increasing your energy levels, or developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you still like to keep "doing stuff" as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
6. User: "Energy, I think? Or maybe consistency?"
7. Chatbot: "Improving your energy levels or developing consistency are both fantastic goals that can have a positive impact on many areas of your life. **Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Follow a structured workout plan  
- Set specific, achievable goals  
- Track progress with a fitness app"
8. User: "Uh, I don't have one?"
9. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve increased energy and a consistent exercise routine. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research different types of exercises and their benefits to determine which ones align with your energy-boosting goals.
   
2. Learn about the role of nutrition and hydration in maintaining energy levels and supporting a consistent exercise routine.

3. Study time management techniques to effectively incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule."
10. User: "Time management maybe? But, confused."
11. Chatbot: "Time management is a great area to focus on for developing a consistent exercise routine. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore time management techniques that can help you incorporate regular exercise into your daily schedule?**"
12. User: "Uh, not sure. Maybe?"
13. Chatbot: "No worries, it's okay to feel unsure. **Would you like to explore different time management strategies to see which ones might work best for you in fitting exercise into your routine?**"
14. User: "Explore strategies? Like which ones?"
15. Chatbot: "You could explore strategies like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, or setting specific time slots for exercise in your calendar. **Would you like to set a learning goal to explore these time management strategies to help you with your exercise routine?**"
16. User: "Um, maybe Pomodoro? Sounds fun."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring the Pomodoro Technique already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday."
18. User: "Three strategies? By Friday, huh?"
19. Chatbot: "Yes, identifying three strategies by a specific day like Friday can make your goal more concrete. **Would you like to set this as your specific goal, or do you have another day in mind?**"
20. User: "Uh, Friday seems okay."
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three strategies today.  
2. Choosing a strategy by Wednesday.  
3. Identifying five strategies by Friday."
22. User: "Three seems hard now."
23. Chatbot: "I understand, and it's important to set a goal that feels achievable. **Would you like to stick with identifying three strategies by Friday, or perhaps adjust it to two strategies to make it more manageable?**"
24. User: "Two strategies by Friday, maybe."
25. Chatbot: "That sounds like a more manageable goal. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by trying to implement one of the strategies by Friday as well?**"
26. User: "Implement? By Friday? Um, confused."
27. Chatbot: "I apologize for the confusion. I meant trying out one of the strategies you identify by Friday. **Would you like to keep the goal as identifying two strategies by Friday, or try one of them as well?**"
28. User: "Just identify two strategies."
29. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a clear goal to identify two Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read articles on Pomodoro exercise strategies.  
2. Watch videos on Pomodoro workout techniques.  
3. Listen to podcasts about Pomodoro fitness methods.  "
30. User: "Podcasts maybe? But distracted."
31. Chatbot: "Listening to podcasts is a great way to learn while multitasking. **Do you think listening to a podcast about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task could help you stay focused?**"
32. User: "Uh, maybe. I'll try."
33. Chatbot: "That's a great idea! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of listening to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I start my morning coffee, I'll listen to a Pomodoro exercise podcast.
2. When I begin my lunch break, I'll play a podcast on Pomodoro strategies.
3. If I start my evening walk, I'll tune into a Pomodoro exercise podcast."
34. User: "Um, after lunch maybe?"
35. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch that could serve as a reliable environment for this cue?**"
36. User: "Usually at my desk."
37. Chatbot: "Great! **Would you like to set the cue as "When I finish lunch at my desk, I'll listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task"?** This way, it's tied to a specific location and event."
38. User: "Sure, that sounds okay."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying strategies. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your podcast listening."
40. User: "I guess that's fine!"
41. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify two Pomodoro strategies for exercise by Friday.

**Action:** Listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish lunch at my desk then listen to podcasts about Pomodoro exercise strategies while doing a simple task"
42. User: "Wait, we're done? Oh, okay."
43. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
