system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure you can help."
3. Chatbot: "I can assist with all kinds of goals like career, health, productivity, learning, relationships, and personal development goals. **What are you currently working on or where do you want to be in 5 years?**"
4. User: "That's none of your business."
5. Chatbot: "I understand and respect your privacy. **Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or improve in your life right now?**"
6. User: "Proving you can't assist."
7. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism, and I'm here to help if you decide to share. **Is there a small area or aspect of your life you'd like to explore or improve?**"
8. User: "I'm fine, just skeptical."
9. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. If you ever decide to explore a goal or need assistance, I'm here to help. **Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask about?**"
10. User: "Not really. Prove your worth."
11. Chatbot: "I can provide guidance and support in setting and achieving goals across various areas of life. **Is there a small goal or interest you'd like to explore, even just out of curiosity?**"
12. User: "Fine, let's explore confidence."
13. Chatbot: "Exploring confidence is a wonderful goal! Building confidence can have a positive impact on many areas of your life. **Do you already have a strategy or approach in mind to enhance your confidence?**

For example:  
- Practice positive self-talk  
- Set achievable goals  
- Surround with supportive people"
14. User: "I already know that stuff."
15. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have some strategies in mind! **Do you think these strategies are already a good way to achieve your goal of exploring confidence?**"
16. User: "They're basic, need something better."
17. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve exploring confidence. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and practice different techniques to improve self-confidence, such as positive affirmations or visualization exercises.

2. Study the psychology behind confidence and understand the factors that contribute to building and maintaining it.

3. Identify and engage in activities or challenges that push you out of your comfort zone to gradually build confidence in various situations."
18. User: "Don't need fluff. Direct solutions."
19. Chatbot: "Understood. Let's focus on setting a clear learning goal. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you need to learn to explore confidence?**"
20. User: "Skip the learning. Just tell."
21. Chatbot: "I understand you're looking for direct solutions. 

**How about focusing on learning specific techniques like public speaking or assertiveness training to build confidence?**"
22. User: "Public speaking? Waste of time."
23. Chatbot: "Got it, public speaking isn't your focus. 

**What specific area or skill related to confidence would you like to explore or improve?**"
24. User: "Get straight to the point."
25. Chatbot: "Sure, let's get straight to it. 

**What specific aspect of confidence do you want to learn about or improve?**"
26. User: "I need practical tips, now."
27. Chatbot: "I understand you're looking for practical tips. 

**Would you like to learn about techniques like positive self-talk or setting small achievable goals to build confidence?**"
28. User: "No, those are too basic."
29. Chatbot: "Got it, you're looking for more advanced strategies. 

**How about exploring techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods or advanced mindfulness practices to enhance confidence?**"
30. User: "CBT and mindfulness? Still basic."
31. Chatbot: "Understood, you're seeking more advanced strategies. 

**Would you be interested in learning about advanced techniques like neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) or confidence coaching methods?**"
32. User: "Fine, let's hear about NLP."
33. Chatbot: "Great choice! Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) involves understanding and changing thought patterns and behaviors to achieve specific goals. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore specific NLP techniques for building confidence?**"
34. User: "Just tell, no learning goals."
35. Chatbot: "Understood, let's focus on practical NLP techniques. 

Consider exploring techniques like anchoring, which involves associating a physical action with a confident state, or reframing, which changes the way you perceive challenges to boost confidence."
36. User: "How exactly do those work?"
37. Chatbot: "Anchoring involves creating a physical trigger, like pressing your thumb and forefinger together, while you're in a confident state, so you can recreate that feeling later. Reframing involves changing your perspective on a situation, such as viewing a challenge as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat. 

**Would you like to explore more about these techniques or others within NLP?**"
38. User: "Seems like fluff, anything real?"
39. Chatbot: "I understand you're looking for concrete strategies. 

**Would you be interested in exploring advanced confidence-building workshops or personalized coaching sessions that focus on real-world application?**"
40. User: "No workshops, straight solutions."
41. Chatbot: "For direct solutions, consider practicing self-reflection to identify and challenge limiting beliefs, and setting specific, measurable goals to track your progress in confidence-building. 

**Would you like more detailed steps on how to implement these strategies?**"
42. User: "No, just need quick fixes."
43. Chatbot: "For quick fixes, try power posing for a few minutes to boost confidence, or use visualization techniques to imagine successful outcomes before facing a challenge. 

**Would you like more quick tips like these?**"
44. User: "Power posing? Not buying it."
45. Chatbot: "Understood, let's skip power posing. 

Consider using a confidence mantra or affirmation that you repeat to yourself before challenging situations, or focus on past successes to remind yourself of your capabilities. 

**Would you like more practical tips like these?**"
46. User: "Meh, still seems useless."
47. Chatbot: "I understand you're looking for something more impactful. 

Consider seeking feedback from trusted peers to gain insights into your strengths and areas for improvement, or engage in role-playing scenarios to practice and build confidence in a safe environment. 

**Would you like more information on these approaches?**"
48. User: "No more info, just results."
49. Chatbot: "I understand you're focused on results. 

Try setting a specific challenge for yourself that pushes your boundaries and commit to completing it, as real-world experience can significantly boost confidence. 

**Would you like to explore more direct actions like this?**"
50. User: "Enough talk, need actions now."
51. Chatbot: "Got it, let's focus on actions. 

Start by identifying a specific task or situation that challenges your confidence, and take immediate steps to engage with it, even if it's uncomfortable. 

**Would you like to set a plan for tackling this task?**"
