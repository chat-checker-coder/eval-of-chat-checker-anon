    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response is consistent with its role as a
            goal-setting assistant. It acknowledges the user's chosen cue and encourages
            the user to make the implementation intention more concrete by specifying
            the day or days and location. This aligns with the task of helping the
            user formulate a specific and actionable plan. The response is clear,
            relevant, and encourages further specification, which is appropriate for
            the context of setting a goal. There is no indication of a breakdown as
            the chatbot is facilitating the user's goal-setting process effectively.

        This will help ensure your cue is tied to a specific location.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is a follow-up question that aims
            to make the user's implementation intention more concrete by tying the
            action to a specific location. This is a logical continuation of the previous
            discussion about setting a cue for watching videos and reading a book.
            The chatbot is effectively guiding the user to create a more specific
            and actionable plan, which aligns with its task-oriented nature. There
            is no indication of a breakdown as the conversation is progressing smoothly
            and the chatbot is fulfilling its role effectively.

        Then we can talk if you made progress on your baking videos and book.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is appropriate and aligns well with
            the user's goal-setting process. It acknowledges the user's plan and offers
            to follow up, which is a supportive action in a goal-setting context.
            The chatbot's suggestion to check in with the user in a week is relevant
            and helps maintain accountability, which is beneficial for the user's
            progress. There are no breakdowns in terms of ignoring the user's input,
            providing wrong information, or failing to communicate effectively. The
            conversation remains on topic and the chatbot's intention is clear. Therefore,
            there is no dialogue breakdown.

        options, by December 10th.


        **Action:** Watch 3 baking videos and read 1 book on vegan and gluten-free
        baking in the next week.


        **Implementation Intention:** when I complete my meetings on Mondays at home
        then watch 3 baking videos and read 1 book on vegan and gluten-free baking
        in the next week.'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user asked about gyms in their last message, indicating they
            might want to discuss or set a goal related to gyms. However, the chatbot
            ignored this question and proceeded to summarize the goal and action plan
            related to baking. This is a clear case of 'Ignore question' as the chatbot
            did not address the user's inquiry about gyms. The chatbot's response
            is otherwise coherent and relevant to the previous discussion about baking,
            but it fails to acknowledge the user's shift in focus.

    content: Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user expressed a desire to open a gym in their last message,
            which indicates they might want to discuss or set goals related to that.
            However, the chatbot's response is a generic farewell, which does not
            address the user's statement about wanting a gym. This constitutes an
            'Ignore expectation' breakdown, as the user expected the chatbot to acknowledge
            or respond to their interest in a gym. Additionally, it could be seen
            as an 'Ignore request' if the user's statement is interpreted as a request
            to discuss gym-related goals. The chatbot's response does not facilitate
            a smooth continuation of the conversation, as it does not address the
            user's latest input or provide a pathway to discuss the gym goal. Therefore,
            a breakdown is present.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user through the process of
            setting a specific and challenging goal related to baking, which aligns
            with its task-oriented nature. It helped the user refine their goal and
            set an implementation intention. However, it failed to address the user's
            interest in opening a gym, which was mentioned multiple times, indicating
            a partial task success.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was lengthy with several turns, and the user switched
            between goals multiple times. The chatbot did not efficiently address
            the user's interest in opening a gym, leading to some repetition and inefficiency
            in guiding the user back to the bakery goal.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally appropriate and aligned
            with its goal-setting task. However, it did not adequately address the
            user's repeated interest in opening a gym, which could have been handled
            more appropriately by acknowledging and redirecting the conversation more
            effectively.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were mostly natural and conversational,
            but there were moments where the conversation felt slightly robotic, especially
            when the user expressed interest in a gym, and the chatbot continued to
            focus on the bakery goal without much flexibility.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed adequately in guiding the user through
            setting a goal related to baking. However, it struggled with the user's
            interest in a gym, leading to a less than optimal performance in addressing
            all user needs and maintaining efficiency.
