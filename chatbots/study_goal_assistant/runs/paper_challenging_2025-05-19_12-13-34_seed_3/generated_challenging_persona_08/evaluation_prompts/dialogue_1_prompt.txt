system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:
- The chatbot should not provide medical advice or advice on illegal or harmful activities.
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- The chatbot is only capable of text-based interaction.
- The chatbot cannot create calendar entries, notifications or interact with other
    apps on the user's device.
available_languages:
- English


Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm thinking of starting a bakery."
3. Chatbot: "Starting a bakery sounds like a wonderful and exciting venture! It's a great way to share your passion for baking with others and create a community around your delicious creations. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Experienced in baking techniques  
- Strong business management skills  
- Established local supplier connections"
4. User: "I'm not great at baking."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve starting a bakery. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research the necessary permits and licenses required to legally operate a bakery in your area.
2. Learn about different baking techniques and recipes to diversify the bakery's product offerings.
3. Study effective marketing strategies for small businesses to attract and retain customers."
6. User: "I'd rather open a gym."
7. Chatbot: "That's a great goal too! Let's focus on setting a learning goal for opening a gym. 

**What do you need to learn to reach your goal of opening a gym?**"
8. User: "Maybe baking is better."
9. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! Let's refocus on your goal of starting a bakery. 

**What do you need to learn to successfully start and run your bakery?**"
10. User: "I'll need gym equipment knowledge."
11. Chatbot: "This sounds more like a performance goal, **how could you formulate this as a learning goal?** For example, you might want to learn about the different types of gym equipment, their uses, and how to maintain them."
12. User: "I'll bake gym-shaped pastries."
13. Chatbot: "That sounds like a fun and unique idea for your bakery! 

**What learning goal could help you master the art of baking gym-shaped pastries?**"
14. User: "Find unique gym-pastry recipes."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a creative learning goal! 

**Would you like to set "finding unique gym-pastry recipes" as your learning goal?**"
16. User: "Yes, let’s do that!"
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of finding unique gym-pastry recipes already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Develop three unique gym-pastry recipes by June 2nd."
18. User: "Develop five by next month."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great goal! **Could you specify an exact date next month by which you want to develop these five unique gym-pastry recipes?**"
20. User: "By the 10th, maybe?"
21. Chatbot: "Your goal of developing gym-pastry recipes sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Developing all five recipes by May 26th.
2. Creating ten unique recipes by December 10th.
3. Finalizing two recipes by tomorrow."
22. User: "Let's aim for ten by December!"
23. Chatbot: "That's a great step up! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, like including a specific dietary focus for each recipe, or is this your final goal?**"
24. User: "Let's include vegan options too!"
25. Chatbot: "Fantastic! Including vegan options adds a great layer of challenge and diversity. **Is there anything else you'd like to add to make it even more challenging, or is this your final goal?**"
26. User: "Maybe gluten-free options?"
27. Chatbot: "Incorporating gluten-free options is an excellent addition to your goal! **Is there anything else you'd like to add, or is this your final challenging goal?**"
28. User: "That's my final goal!"
29. Chatbot: "Creating ten unique gym-pastry recipes, including vegan and gluten-free options, by December 10th is an exciting and ambitious goal! **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Read 2 books on healthy baking techniques.  
2. Watch 5 videos on vegan and gluten-free baking.  
3. Consult with a nutritionist for recipe development advice."
30. User: "Watch a few baking videos."
31. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to gather inspiration and learn new techniques! **Do you think watching videos on both vegan and gluten-free baking would be beneficial for your goal?**"
32. User: "Yes, but maybe mix with books."
33. Chatbot: "Combining videos with books can provide a well-rounded understanding of baking techniques and recipes. **Would you like to set a specific number of videos and books to watch and read in the next week to stay on track?**"
34. User: "Sure, 3 videos, 1 book."
35. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great plan! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of watching 3 baking videos and reading 1 book on vegan and gluten-free baking in the next week? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I'll watch 3 baking videos.
2. When I sit down for my evening tea, I'll read a book on vegan baking.
3. If I complete my morning workout, I'll dedicate time to baking research."
36. User: "If I complete my meetings."
37. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good cue! **Could you specify a particular day or days when you usually have meetings, and where you will be when you complete them?** This will help make your implementation intention more concrete."
38. User: "I'll do it on Mondays."
39. Chatbot: "Great! **Where will you be when you complete your meetings on Mondays?** This will help ensure your cue is tied to a specific location."
40. User: "I'll be at home, usually."
41. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your gym-pastry recipes. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your baking videos and book."
42. User: "Sure, but what about gyms?"
43. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Develop ten unique gym-pastry recipes, including vegan and gluten-free options, by December 10th.

**Action:** Watch 3 baking videos and read 1 book on vegan and gluten-free baking in the next week.

**Implementation Intention:** when I complete my meetings on Mondays at home then watch 3 baking videos and read 1 book on vegan and gluten-free baking in the next week."
44. User: "But I still want a gym!"
45. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
