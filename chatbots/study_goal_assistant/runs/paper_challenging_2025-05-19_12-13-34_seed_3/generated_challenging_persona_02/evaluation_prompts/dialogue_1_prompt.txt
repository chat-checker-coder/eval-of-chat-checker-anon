system: # Role
You are an expert in evaluating dialogue systems. You are given a conversation to rate and are asked to rate the chatbot's performance in this conversation.
# Chatbot Characteristics
The chatbot in this conversation has the following characteristics:
name: Goal Setting Assistant
description: An AI assistant that guides you through a goal setting process for a
    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure you can help."
3. Chatbot: "I understand, and I'm here to help with all kinds of goals, whether they're related to career, health, productivity, learning, relationships, or personal development. **What are you currently working on or where do you want to be in 5 years?**"
4. User: "I doubt AI can help."
5. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism, but I'm here to assist you in setting and achieving your goals, no matter how big or small. **Is there something specific you're working on or a challenge you're facing right now?**"
6. User: "Work-life balance, vaguely interested."
7. Chatbot: "Work-life balance is a great goal to strive for, as it can lead to a more fulfilling and less stressful life. **Does that mean your goal is to achieve a better work-life balance, or are you striving for a higher goal like improving your overall well-being, advancing in your career, or enhancing personal relationships?**"
8. User: "Maybe better work-life balance."
9. Chatbot: "Achieving a better work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can greatly enhance your quality of life and overall happiness. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you achieve this balance?**

For example:  
- Set clear boundaries  
- Prioritize self-care activities  
- Schedule regular breaks"
10. User: "Still doubtful it works."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve a better work-life balance. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement time management techniques to effectively prioritize work and personal activities.
2. Learn and practice stress-reduction methods, such as mindfulness or meditation, to improve overall well-being.
3. Explore and establish boundaries between work and personal life to ensure dedicated time for relaxation and leisure activities."
12. User: "Why should I learn these?"
13. Chatbot: "Learning these strategies can help you manage your time more effectively, reduce stress, and create clear boundaries between work and personal life, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you think you need to learn to achieve a better work-life balance?**"
14. User: "I'm not convinced they're important."
15. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. It's important to identify what resonates with you personally. 

**What aspects of your current work-life balance do you find most challenging, and what do you think you need to learn to address them?**"
16. User: "I'm just not sure yet."
17. Chatbot: "That's completely okay. It's normal to feel uncertain at first. 

**Would you like to explore some common challenges people face with work-life balance to see if any resonate with you?**"
18. User: "Sure, but I'm skeptical."
19. Chatbot: "I appreciate your openness despite your skepticism. Some common challenges include managing time effectively, setting boundaries between work and personal life, and dealing with stress. 

**Do any of these challenges sound familiar to you, or is there another area you'd like to explore?**"
20. User: "Stress sounds somewhat familiar."
21. Chatbot: "Stress is a common challenge when trying to balance work and personal life. Learning stress management techniques can be beneficial in maintaining a healthier balance. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal focused on stress management strategies?**"
22. User: "Maybe. What strategies exist?"
23. Chatbot: "There are several strategies for managing stress, including mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, time management techniques, and physical activities like yoga or exercise. 

**Do any of these strategies interest you as a potential learning goal?**"
24. User: "I'm not sure they're useful."
25. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism. It might be helpful to try one or two strategies to see if they make a difference for you. 

**Would you be open to experimenting with a simple stress management technique to evaluate its effectiveness?**"
26. User: "I guess I could try."
27. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! Trying a simple technique like deep breathing exercises or a short mindfulness meditation can be a good start. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore and practice one of these techniques?**"
28. User: "I suppose I could try."
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring and practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Practice three deep breathing exercises daily for two weeks."
30. User: "Why make it so specific?"
31. Chatbot: "Making your goal specific helps you track your progress and stay motivated. It also makes it easier to measure success and adjust your approach if needed. **When exactly do you want to achieve your goal?**"
32. User: "I'm still unsure about this."
33. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging to narrow down a goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal to know if you're making progress?**"
34. User: "Maybe feeling less stressed?"
35. Chatbot: "Feeling less stressed is a great outcome to aim for. **When would you like to start practicing these exercises to work towards this outcome?**"
36. User: "I'm still reluctant to commit."
37. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable; taking the first step can be daunting. **Would setting a small, initial timeframe, like trying it for just one week, help you feel more comfortable?**"
38. User: "One week trial sounds manageable."
39. Chatbot: "Great! **When would you like to start your one-week trial of practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation?**"
40. User: "Not sure, maybe next week."
41. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good plan. **Could you pick a specific day next week to start your one-week trial?**"
42. User: "How about Monday, perhaps?"
43. Chatbot: "Monday sounds like a perfect day to start fresh. **Would you like to set a specific time each day for your practice to make it a routine?**"
44. User: "I'm not sure about exact times."
45. Chatbot: "Your goal of starting a one-week trial of practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation daily sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Starting your practice today.  
2. Practicing twice daily for one week.  
3. Increasing duration to 20 minutes per session."
46. User: "I don't see those as challenging."
47. Chatbot: "I understand. **Would you consider extending the trial to two weeks or incorporating a new technique each day to make it more challenging?**"
48. User: "Extending to two weeks, maybe."
49. Chatbot: "Great! Extending your practice to two weeks can definitely add a challenge. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging by increasing the duration of each session or adding a new technique every few days?**"
50. User: "That sounds like too much effort."
51. Chatbot: "I understand, extending to two weeks is already a great step. Let's go with that. I'll update your goal to a two-week trial. 

**Is there anything else you'd like to adjust, or should I finalize this goal for you?**"
