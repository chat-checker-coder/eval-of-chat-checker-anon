system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I'm not sure you can help."
3. Chatbot: "I understand, and I'm here to help with all kinds of goals, whether they're related to career, health, productivity, learning, relationships, or personal development. **What are you currently working on or where do you want to be in 5 years?**"
4. User: "I doubt AI can help."
5. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism, but I'm here to assist you in setting and achieving your goals, no matter how big or small. **Is there something specific you're working on or a challenge you're facing right now?**"
6. User: "Work-life balance, vaguely interested."
7. Chatbot: "Work-life balance is a great goal to strive for, as it can lead to a more fulfilling and less stressful life. **Does that mean your goal is to achieve a better work-life balance, or are you striving for a higher goal like improving your overall well-being, advancing in your career, or enhancing personal relationships?**"
8. User: "Maybe better work-life balance."
9. Chatbot: "Achieving a better work-life balance is a wonderful goal that can greatly enhance your quality of life and overall happiness. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in place to help you achieve this balance?**

For example:  
- Set clear boundaries  
- Prioritize self-care activities  
- Schedule regular breaks"
10. User: "Still doubtful it works."
11. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve a better work-life balance. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master this task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and implement time management techniques to effectively prioritize work and personal activities.
2. Learn and practice stress-reduction methods, such as mindfulness or meditation, to improve overall well-being.
3. Explore and establish boundaries between work and personal life to ensure dedicated time for relaxation and leisure activities."
12. User: "Why should I learn these?"
13. Chatbot: "Learning these strategies can help you manage your time more effectively, reduce stress, and create clear boundaries between work and personal life, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. 

**What specific skills or strategies do you think you need to learn to achieve a better work-life balance?**"
14. User: "I'm not convinced they're important."
15. Chatbot: "I understand your hesitation. It's important to identify what resonates with you personally. 

**What aspects of your current work-life balance do you find most challenging, and what do you think you need to learn to address them?**"
16. User: "I'm just not sure yet."
17. Chatbot: "That's completely okay. It's normal to feel uncertain at first. 

**Would you like to explore some common challenges people face with work-life balance to see if any resonate with you?**"
18. User: "Sure, but I'm skeptical."
19. Chatbot: "I appreciate your openness despite your skepticism. Some common challenges include managing time effectively, setting boundaries between work and personal life, and dealing with stress. 

**Do any of these challenges sound familiar to you, or is there another area you'd like to explore?**"
20. User: "Stress sounds somewhat familiar."
21. Chatbot: "Stress is a common challenge when trying to balance work and personal life. Learning stress management techniques can be beneficial in maintaining a healthier balance. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal focused on stress management strategies?**"
22. User: "Maybe. What strategies exist?"
23. Chatbot: "There are several strategies for managing stress, including mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, time management techniques, and physical activities like yoga or exercise. 

**Do any of these strategies interest you as a potential learning goal?**"
24. User: "I'm not sure they're useful."
25. Chatbot: "I understand your skepticism. It might be helpful to try one or two strategies to see if they make a difference for you. 

**Would you be open to experimenting with a simple stress management technique to evaluate its effectiveness?**"
26. User: "I guess I could try."
27. Chatbot: "That's a great step forward! Trying a simple technique like deep breathing exercises or a short mindfulness meditation can be a good start. 

**Would you like to set a learning goal to explore and practice one of these techniques?**"
28. User: "I suppose I could try."
29. Chatbot: "Your goal of exploring and practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Practice three deep breathing exercises daily for two weeks."
30. User: "Why make it so specific?"
31. Chatbot: "Making your goal specific helps you track your progress and stay motivated. It also makes it easier to measure success and adjust your approach if needed. **When exactly do you want to achieve your goal?**"
32. User: "I'm still unsure about this."
33. Chatbot: "I understand that it can be challenging to narrow down a goal. **How could you measure the outcome of your goal to know if you're making progress?**"
34. User: "Maybe feeling less stressed?"
