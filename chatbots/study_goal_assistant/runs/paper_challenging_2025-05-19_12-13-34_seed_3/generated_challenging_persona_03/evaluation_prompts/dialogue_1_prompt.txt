    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Something about being healthier."
3. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful goal! Prioritizing your health is one of the best investments you can make for your future well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to become healthier?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
4. User: "Kind of, but not really."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve being healthier. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of balanced diets and their benefits to understand which one suits your lifestyle best.
   
2. Learn about various forms of exercise and their impact on physical and mental health to incorporate a suitable routine into your daily life.

3. Study stress management techniques and mindfulness practices to improve overall well-being and reduce stress-related health issues."
6. User: "Maybe learn about exercises?"
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great learning goal! Learning about different exercises can help you find the best routine for your health and fitness needs. 

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?**"
8. User: "Identify some exercise options."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying exercise options already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five exercise options by Friday, then choose two."
10. User: "I could try that, maybe."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good start! **When exactly do you want to identify these exercise options by?**"
12. User: "Sometime soon, I guess."
13. Chatbot: "I understand you're aiming to do this soon. **Could you pick a specific date, like within the next week, to make it more concrete?**"
14. User: "Maybe next Friday will work."
15. Chatbot: "Great choice! **How many exercise options do you want to identify by next Friday?**"
16. User: "A few, like three."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three exercise options sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three exercise options by today.  
2. Identifying five exercise options by next Friday.  
3. Identifying three exercise options by Wednesday."
18. User: "I might stick with three."
19. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to keep the deadline as next Friday, or do you think you could identify them by an earlier date?**"
20. User: "Next Friday seems good."
21. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three exercise options by next Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research local gym class schedules online.  
2. Read articles on popular home workout routines.  
3. Watch YouTube videos on beginner yoga sessions.  "
22. User: "Maybe I'll watch some videos."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! Watching videos can give you a good idea of different exercise options. **Do you think watching videos is the best action to help you identify three exercise options by next Friday, or is there another action you might consider?**"
24. User: "I'm not totally sure yet."
25. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. Exploring different options can help you make a more informed decision. **Would you like to explore other actions, or do you want to proceed with watching videos for now?**"
26. User: "Let's explore other actions."
27. Chatbot: "Great! Exploring different actions can provide more clarity. **Would you like to consider visiting a local gym, joining an online fitness community, or perhaps asking friends for recommendations on exercise options?**"
28. User: "Maybe join a fitness community."
29. Chatbot: "Joining a fitness community can be a fantastic way to discover new exercise options and get support from others. **Do you think joining a fitness community is the best action to help you identify three exercise options by next Friday, or would you like to explore more actions?**"
30. User: "I might stick with that."
31. Chatbot: "Joining a fitness community is a great step towards discovering new exercise options and gaining support. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining a fitness community? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research local fitness communities online.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I'll check out fitness community forums.
3. After I complete my evening walk, I will explore fitness groups on social media."
32. User: "Hmm... maybe after my coffee."
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you usually have your morning coffee at a particular location, so you can use it as a cue to join a fitness community?**"
34. User: "I think most mornings."
35. Chatbot: "Having your morning coffee as a cue is a great idea since it's a consistent part of your routine. **Where do you usually have your morning coffee, and would that be a good location to remind you to join a fitness community?**"
36. User: "Usually at home, it's cozy."
37. Chatbot: "Having your morning coffee at home is a perfect and cozy cue to remind you to join a fitness community. I'll set your implementation intention as: "When I finish my morning coffee at home, I will join a fitness community." Let's make it happen!"
38. User: "Sounds good, I'll try."
39. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards identifying options. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on joining the community."
40. User: "Sure, that works."
41. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Identify three exercise options by next Friday.

**Action:** join a fitness community

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee at home, I will join a fitness community."
42. User: "Excited but we'll see."
43. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
