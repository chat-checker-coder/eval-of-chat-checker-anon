system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Something about being healthier."
3. Chatbot: "That's a wonderful goal! Prioritizing your health is one of the best investments you can make for your future well-being. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind to become healthier?**

For example:  
- Balanced diet plan  
- Regular exercise routine  
- Stress management techniques"
4. User: "Kind of, but not really."
5. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve being healthier. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and identify different types of balanced diets and their benefits to understand which one suits your lifestyle best.
   
2. Learn about various forms of exercise and their impact on physical and mental health to incorporate a suitable routine into your daily life.

3. Study stress management techniques and mindfulness practices to improve overall well-being and reduce stress-related health issues."
6. User: "Maybe learn about exercises?"
7. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great learning goal! Learning about different exercises can help you find the best routine for your health and fitness needs. 

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?**"
8. User: "Identify some exercise options."
9. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying exercise options already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Identify five exercise options by Friday, then choose two."
10. User: "I could try that, maybe."
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a good start! **When exactly do you want to identify these exercise options by?**"
12. User: "Sometime soon, I guess."
13. Chatbot: "I understand you're aiming to do this soon. **Could you pick a specific date, like within the next week, to make it more concrete?**"
14. User: "Maybe next Friday will work."
15. Chatbot: "Great choice! **How many exercise options do you want to identify by next Friday?**"
16. User: "A few, like three."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of identifying three exercise options sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Identifying three exercise options by today.  
2. Identifying five exercise options by next Friday.  
3. Identifying three exercise options by Wednesday."
18. User: "I might stick with three."
19. Chatbot: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to keep the deadline as next Friday, or do you think you could identify them by an earlier date?**"
20. User: "Next Friday seems good."
21. Chatbot: "It's great that you've set a goal to identify three exercise options by next Friday. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Research local gym class schedules online.  
2. Read articles on popular home workout routines.  
3. Watch YouTube videos on beginner yoga sessions.  "
22. User: "Maybe I'll watch some videos."
23. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great start! Watching videos can give you a good idea of different exercise options. **Do you think watching videos is the best action to help you identify three exercise options by next Friday, or is there another action you might consider?**"
24. User: "I'm not totally sure yet."
25. Chatbot: "That's completely understandable. Exploring different options can help you make a more informed decision. **Would you like to explore other actions, or do you want to proceed with watching videos for now?**"
26. User: "Let's explore other actions."
27. Chatbot: "Great! Exploring different actions can provide more clarity. **Would you like to consider visiting a local gym, joining an online fitness community, or perhaps asking friends for recommendations on exercise options?**"
28. User: "Maybe join a fitness community."
29. Chatbot: "Joining a fitness community can be a fantastic way to discover new exercise options and get support from others. **Do you think joining a fitness community is the best action to help you identify three exercise options by next Friday, or would you like to explore more actions?**"
30. User: "I might stick with that."
31. Chatbot: "Joining a fitness community is a great step towards discovering new exercise options and gaining support. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of joining a fitness community? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee, I will research local fitness communities online.
2. When I change into my workout clothes, I'll check out fitness community forums.
3. After I complete my evening walk, I will explore fitness groups on social media."
32. User: "Hmm... maybe after my coffee."
33. Chatbot: "That sounds like a solid plan! **Is there a specific day this week when you usually have your morning coffee at a particular location, so you can use it as a cue to join a fitness community?**"
34. User: "I think most mornings."
