    single goal. It can help with all kinds of goals, including personal development,
    health and fitness, and career advancement.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot must guide the user into formulating a specific and challenging
    goal. It must distinguish between learning goals and performance goals and help
    the user to formulate the first action step towards their goal as an implementation
    intention ("if-then plan").
constraints:

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Can I set 3 goals simultaneously?"
3. Chatbot: "Yes, you can set multiple goals simultaneously. **What are the three goals you'd like to focus on?**"
4. User: "Become a magician, marathon runner, artist."
5. Chatbot: "Wow, those are some exciting and diverse goals! Becoming a magician, a marathon runner, and an artist will certainly challenge and inspire you in different ways. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve each of these goals?**

For example:  
- Mastered sleight of hand  
- Have a mentor magician  
- Extensive magic book collection"
6. User: "I have no strategy yet."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a magician. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and learn about the history and different styles of magic to understand the foundations of the craft.
2. Study and practice basic sleight of hand techniques to develop your manual dexterity and skill.
3. Watch and analyze performances by professional magicians to learn about presentation and showmanship."
8. User: "Can we mix learning methods?"
9. Chatbot: "Absolutely, mixing learning methods can be very effective in mastering a skill like magic. Combining reading, watching videos, attending workshops, and practicing can provide a well-rounded learning experience.

**What combination of learning methods do you think would work best for you?**"
10. User: "Maybe mix videos and practice?"
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great approach! Watching videos can provide visual examples and inspiration, while practice helps you develop the necessary skills and muscle memory.

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?**"
12. User: "Watch magic videos, practice daily."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of watching magic videos and practicing daily already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three magic tricks by Friday, practicing 30 minutes daily."
14. User: "Master one trick weekly."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great goal! **When exactly do you want to start this weekly practice?**"
16. User: "Maybe next Monday morning."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering one magic trick weekly sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Mastering a magic trick by today.  
2. Learning two tricks by next Monday.  
3. Mastering a more complex trick weekly."
18. User: "Two tricks by next Monday."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to push yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "Let's go with three tricks!"
21. Chatbot: "That's an ambitious and exciting goal! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
22. User: "I'm sticking to three tricks!"
23. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal to focus on! Now that I know you want to master magic tricks, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube tutorials on magic tricks.  
2. Read a magic book chapter daily.  
3. Practice tricks with a magician mentor.  "
24. User: "Watch magic tricks on YouTube."
25. Chatbot: "Watching magic tricks on YouTube is a great way to start learning! **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
26. User: "Practice what I watch daily."
27. Chatbot: "That's a great approach to learning! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of practicing what you watch daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will practice a magic trick.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll rehearse a new magic trick.
3. If I turn off my alarm in the morning, I will practice a magic trick."
28. User: "Once my morning coffee's done."
29. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help ensure the location is clear for your implementation intention."
30. User: "In the living room."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering magic. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily practice."
32. User: "Let's focus on other goals."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master three magic tricks weekly, starting next Monday morning.

**Action:** Practice what I watch daily.

**Implementation Intention:** when my morning coffee's done in the living room then practice what I watch daily."
34. User: "But what about my marathon?"
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
