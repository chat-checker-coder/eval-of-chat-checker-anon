    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response acknowledges the user's question about setting
            multiple goals and provides a direct answer, which is appropriate. However,
            the chatbot's task is to guide the user through setting a single goal,
            as per its description. By encouraging the user to set three goals simultaneously,
            the chatbot deviates from its intended task. This constitutes a task performance
            failure, as it does not align with the chatbot's purpose of focusing on
            a single goal. Additionally, the chatbot fails to communicate its capabilities
            and limitations, as it should have informed the user that it is designed
            to handle one goal at a time. Therefore, the response leads to a breakdown

    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally appropriate and aligned
            with its purpose of helping set a goal. However, the abrupt ending when
            the user asked about the marathon goal was inappropriate and left the
            user's request unaddressed.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was mostly natural and conversational, but
            there were instances of repetitive phrasing, especially when asking if
            the user wanted to make the goal more challenging. This repetition made
            the conversation feel less natural.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot partially fulfilled its task by helping the
            user set a specific goal for becoming a magician. However, it failed to
            address the user's request to set multiple goals and ended the conversation
            abruptly when asked about the marathon goal. These issues significantly
            impacted the overall performance.
