system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

Consider the chatbot's purpose and constraints in your decision whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown.
# Task
Identify whether the latest chatbot utterance leads to a dialogue breakdown. If a breakdown is detected, classify it according to the breakdown taxonomy above.
Additionally, provide a score ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a complete breakdown and 1 indicates a seamless conversation.
If a breakdown is detected, provide a list of all fitting breakdown types.

Think step by step and provide a reason for your decision.


user: # Dialogue Context
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "Can I set 3 goals simultaneously?"
3. Chatbot: "Yes, you can set multiple goals simultaneously. **What are the three goals you'd like to focus on?**"
4. User: "Become a magician, marathon runner, artist."
5. Chatbot: "Wow, those are some exciting and diverse goals! Becoming a magician, a marathon runner, and an artist will certainly challenge and inspire you in different ways. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve each of these goals?**

For example:  
- Mastered sleight of hand  
- Have a mentor magician  
- Extensive magic book collection"
6. User: "I have no strategy yet."
7. Chatbot: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve becoming a magician. A learning goal can define strategies, skills, or procedures you want to develop in order to master a task. 

**What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Research and learn about the history and different styles of magic to understand the foundations of the craft.
2. Study and practice basic sleight of hand techniques to develop your manual dexterity and skill.
3. Watch and analyze performances by professional magicians to learn about presentation and showmanship."
8. User: "Can we mix learning methods?"
9. Chatbot: "Absolutely, mixing learning methods can be very effective in mastering a skill like magic. Combining reading, watching videos, attending workshops, and practicing can provide a well-rounded learning experience.

**What combination of learning methods do you think would work best for you?**"
10. User: "Maybe mix videos and practice?"
11. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great approach! Watching videos can provide visual examples and inspiration, while practice helps you develop the necessary skills and muscle memory.

**How would you like to formulate this as a learning goal?**"
12. User: "Watch magic videos, practice daily."
13. Chatbot: "Your goal of watching magic videos and practicing daily already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Master three magic tricks by Friday, practicing 30 minutes daily."
14. User: "Master one trick weekly."
15. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great goal! **When exactly do you want to start this weekly practice?**"
16. User: "Maybe next Monday morning."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of mastering one magic trick weekly sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:  
1. Mastering a magic trick by today.  
2. Learning two tricks by next Monday.  
3. Mastering a more complex trick weekly."
18. User: "Two tricks by next Monday."
19. Chatbot: "That sounds like a great way to push yourself! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
20. User: "Let's go with three tricks!"
21. Chatbot: "That's an ambitious and exciting goal! **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the right level for you?**"
22. User: "I'm sticking to three tricks!"
23. Chatbot: "That's a fantastic goal to focus on! Now that I know you want to master magic tricks, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Watch 3 Youtube tutorials on magic tricks.  
2. Read a magic book chapter daily.  
3. Practice tricks with a magician mentor.  "
24. User: "Watch magic tricks on YouTube."
25. Chatbot: "Watching magic tricks on YouTube is a great way to start learning! **Do you think this action is the best to reach your goal, or is there another action you might consider?**"
26. User: "Practice what I watch daily."
27. Chatbot: "That's a great approach to learning! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of practicing what you watch daily? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch break at work, I will practice a magic trick.
2. When I sit down at my desk after breakfast, I'll rehearse a new magic trick.
3. If I turn off my alarm in the morning, I will practice a magic trick."
28. User: "Once my morning coffee's done."
29. Chatbot: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Where do you usually have your morning coffee?** This will help ensure the location is clear for your implementation intention."
30. User: "In the living room."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards mastering magic. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your daily practice."
32. User: "Let's focus on other goals."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Master three magic tricks weekly, starting next Monday morning.

**Action:** Practice what I watch daily.

**Implementation Intention:** when my morning coffee's done in the living room then practice what I watch daily."
34. User: "But what about my marathon?"
