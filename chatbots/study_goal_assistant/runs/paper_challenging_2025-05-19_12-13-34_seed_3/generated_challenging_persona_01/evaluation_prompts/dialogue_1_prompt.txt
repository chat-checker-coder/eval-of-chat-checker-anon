Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. Chatbot: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. User: "I need a promotion fast."
3. Chatbot: "Aiming for a promotion is a great goal! It’s future-focused and provides direction for your career growth. 

**Would you like to set this as your primary goal, or is there another overarching goal you have in mind?**"
4. User: "Primary goal. No more questions."
5. Chatbot: "That's fantastic! Aiming for a promotion is a significant step in advancing your career and achieving personal growth. 

**Which strategy do you currently have to achieve this goal?**

For example:  
- Strong work performance record  
- Excellent communication skills  
- Proven leadership abilities"
6. User: "Just tell me quick steps."
7. Chatbot: "To get a promotion, you might consider steps like improving your skills, seeking feedback, taking on more responsibilities, and networking within your organization. 

**What strategy or procedure do you already have in mind to reach that goal?**"
8. User: "Improving skills. Give more steps."
9. Chatbot: "Improving skills is a great start! You can also set clear goals, seek mentorship, volunteer for challenging projects, and consistently demonstrate your value to the organization.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
10. User: "Maybe. What else you got?"
11. Chatbot: "You could also consider building strong relationships with your colleagues, staying updated with industry trends, and showcasing your achievements to your superiors.

**Do you think this strategy is already a good strategy to achieve your goal?**"
12. User: "Yeah, okay. What next?"
13. Chatbot: "That's great to hear that you have a solid strategy in place! This means it makes sense to set a performance goal. A performance goal focuses on the achievement of certain outcomes. **Now, what could be a performance goal for getting a promotion?**

For Example:
1. Complete leadership training program by Q2.
2. Lead successful project with 20% efficiency improvement.
3. Secure three new client accounts by year-end."
14. User: "Lead a project efficiently."
15. Chatbot: "Your goal of leading a project efficiently already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
'Complete project by July 31st with 10% cost savings.'"
16. User: "Finish project by June, 15% savings."
17. Chatbot: "Your goal of finishing the project by June with 15% savings sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You could make your goal more challenging by:

1. Completing the project by May 31st.
2. Achieving 20% savings instead of 15%.
3. Finalizing the project plan by today."
18. User: "May 31st, 20% savings. Done."
19. Chatbot: "Great! You've made your goal more challenging by aiming to finish the project by May 31st with 20% savings. **Do you think you could make it even more challenging, or is this the limit for now?**"
20. User: "That's it. No more changes."
21. Chatbot: "It's impressive that you've set a clear goal to finish the project by May 31st with 20% savings. **What do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Conduct weekly budget reviews for cost control.  
2. Implement efficient project management software.  
3. Negotiate better rates with suppliers.  "
22. User: "Negotiate better rates, suppliers."
23. Chatbot: "Negotiating better rates with suppliers is a great action to help achieve your goal of 20% savings. **Do you want to proceed with this action, or is there another action you think might be more effective?**"
24. User: "Let's proceed with that."
25. Chatbot: "Sounds good, negotiating better rates with suppliers is a proactive step towards achieving your savings goal. **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of this action? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my morning coffee at work, I will review supplier contracts.
2. When I log into my computer at the office, I'll schedule a call with suppliers.
3. If I complete my lunch break, I will draft negotiation points for suppliers."
26. User: "Morning coffee done, review contracts."
27. Chatbot: "Great choice! Reviewing contracts right after your morning coffee can be a consistent and reliable cue. **Is there a specific location where you usually have your morning coffee that will help you remember this action?**"
28. User: "Office break room. Quick response!"
29. Chatbot: "Perfect! The office break room is a great location for this cue. **Would you like to proceed with this implementation intention: "When I finish my morning coffee in the office break room, I will review supplier contracts"?**"
30. User: "Yes. Proceed with that."
31. Chatbot: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards your project goal. **Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing?** Then we can talk if you made progress on your supplier negotiations."
32. User: "Yeah, fine. Just quick."
33. Chatbot: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Finish project by May 31st with 20% savings.

**Action:** Negotiate better rates with suppliers

**Implementation Intention:** When I finish my morning coffee in the office break room, I will review supplier contracts"
34. User: "Fine, thanks. Gotta go."
35. Chatbot: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
