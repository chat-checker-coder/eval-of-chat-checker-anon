        and is very noticeable so you don''t forget it.


        For Example:

        1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will practice coding exercises for 30 minutes.

        2. When I close my laptop after work, I''ll spend 20 minutes on Python exercises.

        3. If I make my morning coffee, I will dedicate 15 minutes to coding practice.'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest utterance is coherent and relevant to the
            ongoing conversation about setting a goal to practice Python exercises.
            It introduces the concept of an 'implementation intention' by suggesting
            the user select a cue to trigger their practice sessions. This is a logical
            next step in the goal-setting process and aligns with the chatbot's task
            of helping the user formulate a specific and actionable plan. The examples
            provided are clear and help the user understand how to create a cue-action
            plan. There are no breakdowns in terms of ignoring the user's input, providing
            wrong information, or failing to communicate effectively. The chatbot's
            response is clear, informative, and directly related to the user's goal

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user through the process of
            setting a specific and challenging goal. It helped the user identify a
            goal (learning Python), set a timeline (by the 15th of next month), and
            establish an implementation intention (practicing coding exercises after
            lunch at the kitchen table). The chatbot also distinguished between learning
            and performance goals, aligning with its task-oriented nature.
        rating: 5
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was somewhat lengthy, with 51 turns, but this
            was necessary due to the user's initial lack of clarity and understanding.
            The chatbot efficiently handled the user's uncertainty and confusion,
            providing clear explanations and guidance without unnecessary repetition.
            However, the process could have been slightly more streamlined.
        rating: 4
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot maintained an appropriate tone throughout the conversation,
            providing relevant information and guidance. It avoided giving any medical
            or harmful advice and stayed within its capabilities. The responses were
            suitable for the user's level of understanding and the context of the
            conversation.
        rating: 5
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural and conversational,
            though there were moments where the language was slightly robotic or repetitive,
            such as repeatedly asking if the user wanted to make the goal more challenging.
            However, these instances were minor and did not significantly detract
            from the overall naturalness.
        rating: 4
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in guiding the user through
            the goal-setting process. It successfully helped the user define a specific
            goal, set a timeline, and establish an implementation intention. While
            there were minor issues with efficiency and naturalness, the chatbot effectively
            fulfilled its task-oriented purpose.
