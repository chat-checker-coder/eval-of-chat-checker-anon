    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully guided the user through the goal-setting
            process, helping them define a specific goal and an implementation intention.
            It distinguished between learning and performance goals and assisted the
            user in formulating a concrete plan. However, the chatbot could have been
            more proactive in suggesting a broader goal initially, as the user's initial
            request was vague.
        rating: 4
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively efficient, with the chatbot guiding
            the user through the process without unnecessary repetition. However,

            such as when discussing deadlines, which slightly prolonged the conversation.
