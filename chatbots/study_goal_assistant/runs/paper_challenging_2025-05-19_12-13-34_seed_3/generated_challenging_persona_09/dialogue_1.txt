Chat history:
1. CHATBOT: "Hi! I’m here to help you achieve your goals!
Together, we’ll define a goal step by step and set your first action to get started. **If you have any questions**, need clarification, or would like additional advice, **don’t hesitate to ask me**.

**So, what’s a goal you’d like to work on?**"
2. USER: "I'm trying to find a hobby."
3. CHATBOT: "Finding a hobby sounds more like an action directed toward a broader objective, such as enhancing personal well-being, increasing creativity, or building new skills. **Would you still like to keep finding a hobby as your primary goal?** If not, we could consider setting a more overarching goal."
4. USER: "Eh, just the hobby, please."
5. CHATBOT: "Finding a hobby is a wonderful way to enrich your life and explore new interests. **Do you already have a strategy or plan in mind for discovering a hobby that suits you?**

For example:  
- Explore local hobby groups  
- Try new activities monthly  
- Attend hobby workshops regularly"
6. USER: "Not sure where to start."
7. CHATBOT: "Alright, this sounds more like we should first set a learning oriented goal to make sure you follow the best strategy to achieve finding a hobby. **What could be your learning oriented goal?**

For Example:
1. Explore different types of hobbies by researching online or visiting local community centers to discover what activities are available and might interest you.
   
2. Attend workshops or beginner classes in various activities to gain firsthand experience and determine which hobbies you enjoy the most.

3. Read books or watch videos about different hobbies to understand the skills and knowledge required for each, helping you make an informed decision about which hobby to pursue."
8. USER: "Reading books sounds interesting."
9. CHATBOT: "Great choice! Reading books can open up a world of possibilities and help you discover new interests. **What specific learning goal would you like to set related to reading books as a hobby?**"
10. USER: "I want to read hobby guides."
11. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a fantastic way to explore different hobbies! **How many hobby guides would you like to read to achieve your learning goal?**"
12. USER: "I'm not sure, maybe a couple?"
13. CHATBOT: "Reading a couple of hobby guides is a great start to explore different interests. **Would you like to set a specific number, like two or three, to make your learning goal more concrete?**"
14. USER: "Let's say three for now."
15. CHATBOT: "Your goal of reading three hobby guides already sounds good. **Could you try making your goal even more specific?**

For Example:
Read three hobby guides by June 2nd, choose one hobby."
16. USER: "What's so special about June?"
17. CHATBOT: "June is just an example to help you set a specific deadline. **When exactly do you want to achieve your goal?**"
18. USER: "I'm unsure about a deadline."
19. CHATBOT: "That's understandable. **Is there a particular event or time of year that would motivate you to complete this goal by?**"
20. USER: "No, not really, just anytime."
21. CHATBOT: "No worries, let's aim for a date that feels comfortable for you. **How about setting a deadline for the end of the year, like December 31st?**"
22. USER: "December sounds too far away."
23. CHATBOT: "I understand. **Would you feel comfortable setting a deadline for the end of next month, like November 30th?**"
24. USER: "That sounds more reasonable, okay."
25. CHATBOT: "Your goal of 'finding a hobby' sounds now more specific. **Do you think you could now make it even more challenging while still being achievable for you?** If you can't, this is also okay.

You for example could make your goal challenging by:  
1. Reading all three guides by today.  
2. Choosing a hobby by June 1st.  
3. Or increasing the difficulty by reading five guides."
26. USER: "Three guides by November's enough."
27. CHATBOT: "That's perfectly fine! **Would you like to add any other elements to make it more challenging, or should we stick with your original goal?**"
28. USER: "Let's stick with this plan."
29. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a wonderful goal! Now that I know you want to explore hobbies, **what do you think is the first action you could do in the next 7 days to get closer to your goal?**

You could for example:  
1. Visit a library to find hobby guidebooks.  
2. Join a hobbyist group discussion online.  
3. Attend a local hobby workshop or seminar.  "
30. USER: "Visit the library; sounds simple."
31. CHATBOT: "Visiting the library is a great start! **Do you think this action will help you find the hobby guides you need, or is there another action you might consider?**"
32. USER: "Just visiting the library, thanks."
33. CHATBOT: "Visiting the library is a great idea! **What could be a good cue for you** that triggers the implementation of visiting the library to find hobby guidebooks? It would be best to select a cue that follows a significant event and is very noticeable so you don't forget it.

For Example:
1. If I finish my lunch at work, I will visit the library for hobby guidebooks.
2. When I leave the gym in the evening, I'll stop by the library for hobby guides.
3. If I pass the library on my way home, I will go in to find hobby books."
34. USER: "After lunch seems good."
35. CHATBOT: "That sounds like a reliable cue! **Do you have a specific day in mind this week when you plan to have lunch and then visit the library?**"
36. USER: "I'm thinking maybe Thursday."
37. CHATBOT: "Great choice! **Is there a specific location where you usually have lunch on Thursdays that will remind you to visit the library afterward?**"
38. USER: "I eat at a café nearby."
39. CHATBOT: "Perfect! You just did the first step towards exploring hobbies. Would it be okay if I check in with you in a week to see how you are progressing? Then we can talk if you made progress on your library visit."
40. USER: "I'd appreciate that, thank you."
41. CHATBOT: "Perfect you defined your goal! Now we are done and this is the summary of the goal and action we set together:

**Goal:** Read three hobby guides by November 30th and choose one hobby that resonates with me.

**Action:** Visit the library to find hobby guidebooks.

**Implementation Intention:** when I finish my lunch at the café on Thursday, I will visit the library to find hobby guidebooks."
42. USER: "Thanks, I'll try my best!"
43. CHATBOT: "Goodbye! I hope I was able to help you with your goal. Have a great day!"
