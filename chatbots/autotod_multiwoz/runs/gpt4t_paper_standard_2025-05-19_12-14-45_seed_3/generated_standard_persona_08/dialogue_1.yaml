        arrangements for your business event in Cambridge. Could you please provide
        me with some details about your hotel preferences such as the area, price

        transfer, could you specify your arrival and departure times, as well as any
        preferences for the taxi?

    content: It seems there are no hotels listed as "high-quality" in the database
        near your business venue. Could you please specify any other preferences or
        allow me to search for luxury hotels instead? Regarding your airport transfer,
        I will arrange a private car for your arrival at 10 AM and departure at 6
        PM.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: 'The chatbot''s response addresses both parts of the user''s request:
            hotel arrangements and airport transfer. For the hotel, the chatbot informs
            the user that there are no ''high-quality'' hotels listed near the business
            venue and asks for further preferences or permission to search for luxury
            hotels, which is a reasonable follow-up. For the airport transfer, the
            chatbot confirms the arrangement of a private car for the specified times,
            which aligns with the user''s request. The response is clear, relevant,
            and provides a logical next step for the user to continue the conversation.
            There is no indication of a breakdown in the dialogue.'

            The chatbot asked for necessary details upfront and provided relevant
