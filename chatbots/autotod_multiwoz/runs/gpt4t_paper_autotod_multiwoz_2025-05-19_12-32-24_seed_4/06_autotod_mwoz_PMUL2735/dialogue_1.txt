- Gonville: Prices are $95 for a double room, $119 for a family room, and $79 for a single room.
- Lensfield: Prices are $90 for a double room, $125 for a family room, and $65 for a single room.

11. USER: "What do you recommend?"
12. CHATBOT: "Both Gonville and Lensfield hotels are excellent choices with 3-star ratings and include free parking in the expensive price range. If you prefer a more family-oriented option, Gonville offers a slightly higher priced family room, which might suggest better amenities or space. On the other hand, Lensfield has a more economical option for single rooms if you're traveling alone or looking for a budget-friendly choice. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a reservation at either hotel or need further assistance!"

15. USER: "No, I would like to book the Gonville hotel instead. Can you please book a room for 6 people, 3 nights, starting on Thursday?"
