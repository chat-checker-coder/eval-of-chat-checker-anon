    content: It appears there are no 4-star hotels without internet access available.
        Would you like to adjust your search criteria, or is there anything else I
        can assist you with?
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is relevant and addresses the user's request
            for a 4-star hotel. It provides information that there are no 4-star hotels
            without internet access available, which is a reasonable assumption given
            the common availability of internet in hotels. The chatbot then offers
            to adjust the search criteria or assist with something else, which is
            a helpful and appropriate follow-up. There is no indication of a breakdown
            as the response is clear, relevant, and maintains the flow of the conversation.

        reasoning: The chatbot successfully addressed the user's request by providing
            information on two 4-star hotels in Cambridge that meet the user's criteria
            of being in the expensive price range and offering free parking. The chatbot

        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response provides the user with the requested
            information about the University Arms hotel, including its address, area,
            and postcode. It then appropriately follows up by asking for additional
            details needed to proceed with the booking, such as the number of people,
            the day of stay, and the duration. This response is relevant, clear, and

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provides a list of restaurants in the
            specified area and price range, which aligns with the user's request.
            It also offers to provide more details or make a reservation if the user

            is clear, relevant, and follows the user's request without any errors

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully assisted the user in finding a 4-star
            hotel with specific criteria and provided options for dining in the desired
            area. It also completed a restaurant booking with a reference number.
            However, it initially misunderstood the user's request about internet
            access, which was not a requirement, but it quickly adjusted to the user's
            clarified needs.
