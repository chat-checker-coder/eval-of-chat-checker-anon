        If you need any further assistance or additional information, feel free to
        ask!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully booked a 2-night stay for 3 people starting
            Saturday at the "A and B Guest House" and provided a reservation reference
            number. However, the user also requested a four-star guesthouse, which
            the chatbot did not address. This constitutes an 'Ignore request' breakdown,
            as the chatbot ignored the user's request for a four-star accommodation.
            The rest of the response is clear and provides the necessary information
            about the booking, but the failure to address the star rating request
            is a significant oversight.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provided a list of guesthouses and completed
            a booking for the user, including providing a reference number. It also
            provided information about a sports facility in the east area of Cambridge.
            However, it did not address the user's request for a four-star guesthouse,
            which is a significant oversight.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was handled efficiently with minimal turns. The
            user received the information and booking confirmation quickly. However,
            the chatbot did not confirm the four-star requirement, which could have
            led to a more efficient resolution if addressed.
        rating: 4
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and polite. It provided
            relevant information and booking confirmation. However, it missed addressing
            the user's specific request for a four-star guesthouse, which affects
            the appropriateness of the booking response.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was natural and polite throughout the conversation.
            The responses were clear and well-structured, contributing to a smooth
            interaction.
        rating: 5
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed well in providing information and
            booking services. However, the failure to address the user's request for
            a four-star guesthouse is a significant flaw that impacts the overall
            performance.
