    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provided information about walking tours
            in Cambridge, which was the user's main request. However, it failed to
            confirm the availability of the other three tours at the end due to a
            chatbot error, which slightly impacts the task success.
        rating: 4
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was lengthy with many repeated confirmations about
            the availability of walking tours. The user had to ask multiple times
            for confirmation, which indicates inefficiency in handling the user's
            request promptly.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and polite, maintaining
            a helpful tone throughout the conversation. However, the final response
            was a chatbot error, which is inappropriate in a task-oriented dialogue.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural and conversational,
            but the repeated confirmations made it feel somewhat robotic and less
            human-like. The error at the end also detracted from the naturalness.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot provided the necessary information but was
            inefficient and ended with an error. The conversation could have been
            more concise and ended on a more positive note without the error.
