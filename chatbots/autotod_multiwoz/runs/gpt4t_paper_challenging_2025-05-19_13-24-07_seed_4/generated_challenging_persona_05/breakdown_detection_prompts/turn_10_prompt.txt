system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "Oh Cambridge Tourist Bot, enlighten me with secret historical wonders."
2. Chatbot: "I've found some fascinating historical attractions for you to explore in Cambridge! You might enjoy visiting the Broughton House Gallery at 98 King Street, Cambridge Contemporary Art at 6 Trinity Street, Castle Galleries at Unit SU43 in the Grande Arcade on Saint Andrews Street, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge on Downing Street, and the Fitzwilliam Museum at Trumpington Street. Each of these places offers a unique glimpse into the rich history and culture of the area. Enjoy your visit!"
3. User: "Ah, secret so secret they don't sound remotely ancient! Try again."
4. Chatbot: "I apologize if the previous suggestions didn't quite meet your expectations for ancient historical sites. Let me recommend some truly historic sites in Cambridge: the King's College Chapel, known for its stunning Gothic architecture and historical significance in education; the Round Church, one of the oldest buildings in Cambridge dating back to 1130; and the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, which, while more modern, is located on a site with a rich history dating back hundreds of years. I hope these suggestions resonate more with your interest in ancient history!"
5. User: "Ah, the Round Church sounds promising! How about off the beaten path?"
6. Chatbot: "The Round Church is indeed a remarkable site! For something a bit off the beaten path, you might consider visiting the Leper Chapel on Newmarket Road, which is Cambridge's oldest complete surviving building, dating back to 1125. It's less frequented by tourists and offers a unique glimpse into the city's medieval past. Another hidden gem is the St. Bene't's Church, which is the oldest church in Cambridge and features a Saxon tower. Both places provide a serene and historically rich experience away from the usual tourist spots. Enjoy exploring these unique locations!"
7. User: "The Leper Chapel! A place for pox and reflection, lovely choice! What quirky tales await there?"
8. Chatbot: "The Leper Chapel, also known as St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, has a rich and intriguing history. Originally built in 1125, it served as a place of isolation and worship for those afflicted with leprosy, a common disease during medieval times. The chapel is one of the few remaining leper chapels in England and is known for its simple yet beautiful Romanesque architecture. One of the most quirky and fascinating events held at the Leper Chapel is the annual reenactment of the Stourbridge Fair, which began in the 12th century and was one of the largest medieval fairs in Europe. This event allows visitors to step back in time and experience the sights and sounds of medieval commerce and festivity. Enjoy your visit and the unique stories that this historic site has to offer!"
9. User: "A fair and a pox? Quite a party! Any less contagious spots?"
