system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "I'm looking to book train tickets in person in Cambridge. Where can I do that?"
2. Chatbot: "To book train tickets in person in Cambridge, you can visit the train station directly. The main station, Cambridge Railway Station, is located at Station Road. There, you can find ticket counters where staff can assist you with your booking. If you need directions or further assistance, feel free to ask!"
3. User: "Can I trust in-person booking? How secure is my data there?"
4. Chatbot: "Yes, you can trust in-person booking at train stations. The staff at the ticket counters are trained to handle your personal information securely, and they follow strict protocols to ensure that your data is protected. If you have any concerns about data security, you can always ask the staff about their privacy policies and the measures they take to safeguard your information."
5. User: "How do I know they're really trained? Can you prove it?"
6. Chatbot: "While I don't have specific proof of the training programs for staff at train stations, it is standard practice for employees handling sensitive information, such as personal and payment details, to receive training on data protection and customer service. This training ensures they are well-equipped to manage transactions securely and assist customers effectively. If you're at the station, you can also inquire directly about their training and security measures to get more detailed information."
7. User: "The usual evasion. Can’t fully trust without proof, you know?"
8. Chatbot: "I understand your concerns about needing proof to fully trust the security measures in place. It's important to feel confident about how your personal information is handled. While I can't provide direct proof, I recommend speaking with the staff at the train station or checking the official railway service website for more detailed information on their security protocols and staff training. This might help address your concerns more concretely. If there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know!"
9. User: "You just redirect when challenged! Not very reassuring, are you?"
10. Chatbot: "I apologize if my responses have not been fully reassuring. My aim is to provide helpful and accurate information based on the data available to me. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any topic, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you. Your trust and confidence in the information provided are very important."
11. User: "I just want real human help. Isn't that possible?"
12. Chatbot: "I understand your preference for human assistance. While I'm here to provide information and help with various tasks digitally, I recommend visiting local information centers, such as the Cambridge Visitor Information Centre, where you can speak directly with staff for personalized assistance. They can offer guidance, recommendations, and support for all your needs in Cambridge. If there's anything else I can do to assist you here, please let me know!"
13. User: "Will they know about secure train bookings, or just tourist stuff?"
14. Chatbot: "I can assist with both secure train bookings and tourist-related inquiries. Whether you need to book a train ticket or find attractions and other travel services in Cambridge, feel free to ask for help!"
15. User: "But you’re a bot. How can I know it’s accurate?"
16. Chatbot: "I understand your concern about accuracy. Rest assured, I am designed to access up-to-date and reliable databases for travel-related information and bookings. My responses are based on the latest available data, and I strive to provide the most accurate and helpful information possible. If you have any specific queries or need assistance, please let me know how I can help you!"
17. User: "I preferred confirmation from a human, not a bot's database."
18. Chatbot: "I completely understand your preference for human confirmation. While I am here to provide immediate assistance and information based on reliable databases, I recommend verifying any critical details or reservations with a human agent or directly with the service provider for your peace of mind. If there's anything else you'd like to know or another way I can assist you, please feel free to ask."
19. User: "This tech lacks the real touch of human interaction."
20. Chatbot: "I appreciate your feedback on the importance of human interaction. While I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, I understand that technology might not fully replicate the nuances of personal communication. If there are specific aspects of your travel plans or inquiries where you feel a human touch is necessary, I encourage you to consult directly with service providers or local experts. Meanwhile, I'm here to offer any immediate assistance or information you might need. Please let me know how I can assist you further!"
21. User: "You just repeat the same thing. Can’t match a real person."
22. Chatbot: "I'm here to assist you as best as I can! If you have any specific requests or need help with travel arrangements in Cambridge, please let me know how I can assist you.
```"
23. User: "Is talking to real humans at the Visitor Centre effective?"
24. Chatbot: "Talking to real humans at the Visitor Centre can be very effective for getting personalized assistance and detailed information about Cambridge. They can provide insights, recommendations, and help with bookings that might be more specific to your needs. If you have any questions or need assistance with planning your visit, they are a great resource."
25. User: "Why trust a bot on this? How are they effective?"
26. Chatbot: "Trusting a bot like me can be effective for several reasons. Firstly, I can provide instant responses to your queries, which is convenient when you need quick information or assistance. Additionally, I have access to a vast amount of data and can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, from finding restaurants and booking hotels to suggesting attractions and arranging transportation. This efficiency and the ability to pull up-to-date information can make your planning process smoother and faster. However, for more personalized interactions or complex scenarios, speaking with a human at a Visitor Centre can complement the information and services I provide."
