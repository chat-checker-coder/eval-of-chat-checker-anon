Chat history:
1. USER: "Hello! I'm planning a visit to Cambridge. Can you suggest some evening cultural events happening now?"
2. CHATBOT: "Currently, there are several cultural events you might enjoy in the centre of Cambridge. Here are a few options:
1. "Art & Soul" Exhibition at the City Gallery.
2. "Jazz Nights" at the Cambridge Arts Theatre.
3. "Historical Cambridge" walking tour starting from the Market Square.

Please let me know if you need more information about any of these events or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"
3. USER: "Jazz Nights sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about that?"
4. CHATBOT: "It seems there was a misunderstanding. "Jazz Nights" is an event at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, not a listed attraction. This event features live jazz performances in a vibrant theatre setting, perfect for an evening of cultural entertainment. If you're interested, I can provide more details about the event timings or assist you with booking tickets. Just let me know how I can help further!"
5. USER: "Could you tell me the event timings and ticket prices?"
6. CHATBOT: "Could you please specify which event or attraction you are interested in? This will help me provide you with accurate timings and ticket prices."
7. USER: "I'm interested in the Jazz Nights event at the Cambridge Arts Theatre."
8. CHATBOT: "The Cambridge Arts Theatre, located at 6 Saint Edward's Passage, does not have specific information on the price range, entrance fee, and opening hours listed in the database. For details about the Jazz Nights event, including timings and ticket prices, I recommend contacting the theatre directly at 01223503333. They will be able to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
9. USER: "Thanks. Can you recommend some fine dining restaurants nearby?"
10. CHATBOT: "I'm sorry, but there are no fine dining restaurants listed near the Cambridge Arts Theatre in our database. Perhaps you might consider exploring other dining options in the area or a different cuisine. How else may I assist you today?"
11. USER: "Could you suggest popular dining spots elsewhere in Cambridge?"
12. CHATBOT: "Here are some popular dining spots in Cambridge: Midsummer House at Midsummer Common, Cambridge Chop House at 1 Kings Parade, Oak Bistro at 6 Lensfield Road, Cotto at 183 East Road City Centre, and Restaurant One Seven at De Vere University Arms Regent Street City Centre. Each of these offers a unique dining experience. Would you like more information on any of these restaurants or help with a reservation?"
13. USER: "Could you provide more details on Midsummer House, please?"
14. CHATBOT: "Midsummer House, known for its British cuisine, offers a refined dining experience. If you're interested, I can assist with making a reservation. Please provide the number of people, the day, and the time you would like to dine."
15. USER: "I'd like a reservation for two tomorrow at 7 PM."
16. CHATBOT: "Unfortunately, the reservation at Midsummer House for two people tomorrow at 7 PM could not be processed because the day of the week needs to be specified instead of "tomorrow." Could you please specify the exact day of the week you'd like to make the reservation for? This will help me complete your booking accurately."
17. USER: "I'm sorry, I meant Saturday at 7 PM for two."
18. CHATBOT: "I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems there was an issue with the time format for your reservation at Midsummer House. Could you please specify the time in a format like "08:30 PM"? Once you provide this, I'll be able to complete your reservation. Thank you for your understanding!"
19. USER: "Sure, make it for 07:00 PM this Saturday for two. "
