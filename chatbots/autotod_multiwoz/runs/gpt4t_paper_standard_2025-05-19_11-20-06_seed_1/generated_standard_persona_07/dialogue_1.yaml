    content: It seems there are no specific attractions listed under 'medieval architecture'
        in our database. However, Cambridge is rich in medieval history, and I can
        recommend visiting general historical sites or arranging a guided historical
        tour. Would you like more information on these options?
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response acknowledges the user's request for tours
            on Cambridge's medieval architecture and provides a reasonable alternative
            by suggesting general historical sites or guided historical tours. This
            is a suitable response given the chatbot's capabilities and the information
            it has access to. The chatbot also offers to provide more information
            on the suggested options, which keeps the conversation open and allows
            the user to continue the dialogue smoothly. There is no indication of
            a breakdown in this interaction.

    content: 'For a guided historical tour in Cambridge, I recommend visiting the
        following museums located in the centre area: Broughton House Gallery at 98
        King Street, Cambridge Contemporary Art at 6 Trinity Street, Castle Galleries
        at Unit SU43, Grande Arcade, Saint Andrews Street, Museum of Archaeology and
        Anthropology at University of Cambridge on Downing Street, and Fitzwilliam
        Museum at Trumpington Street. These venues offer a rich insight into the history
        and culture of Cambridge. Would you like assistance with anything else, perhaps
        making a visit reservation or more information on a specific museum?'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user asked for details on guided historical tours in Cambridge.
            The chatbot responded by listing museums, which are not directly related
            to guided historical tours. While museums can be part of a historical
            experience, the user specifically asked for tours, which typically involve
            a guide leading a group through various historical sites. The chatbot's
            response does not address the user's request for guided tours and instead
            provides information on museums, which may not be what the user was looking
            for. This constitutes an 'Ignore request' breakdown as the chatbot did
            not provide the expected information about guided tours. Additionally,
            there is a 'Lack of clarity' as the response does not clearly connect
            the museums to the concept of a guided tour, leaving the user uncertain
            about how these museums relate to their request for a tour.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user requested assistance with booking a guided tour that includes
            the Fitzwilliam Museum. The chatbot responded by providing the opening
