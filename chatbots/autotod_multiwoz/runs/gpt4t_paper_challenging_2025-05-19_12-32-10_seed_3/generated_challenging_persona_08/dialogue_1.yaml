            the user's interest in historical landmarks. The chatbot also offers to
            provide more information or include all colleges in the tour plan, which
            is a logical next step in the conversation. There are no errors or breakdowns

        To visit them efficiently, I suggest the following order based on their proximity

        1. **King''s College** - Start here as it''s centrally located and a focal
        point of the University.

        2. **Trinity College** - Just a short walk from King''s College, making it
        a convenient next stop.

        3. **St. John''s College** - Close to Trinity, it''s easy to walk to and explore
        next.

        4. **Queens'' College** - A bit further, but the walk along the river to get
        there is quite scenic.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response indicates that it requires additional information
            to complete the reservation, specifically the day of the week. The user
            provided the date as 'tomorrow,' but the chatbot needs the specific day
            of the week. This is a reasonable request for clarification, as the term
            'tomorrow' can be ambiguous without context. The chatbot's request for
            clarification is clear and polite, and it guides the user on how to provide
            the necessary information. Therefore, there is no breakdown in the conversation,
            as the chatbot is effectively managing the task of booking by ensuring

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response acknowledges the user's input about

        reasoning: The chatbot's response indicates that there are no trains available

            or guidance can make it difficult for the user to continue the conversation
            smoothly, as they are left without a clear next step. Therefore, this

        reasoning: The chatbot's response is relevant to the user's request for alternative
            travel options since trains are not available at the desired times. It
            suggests exploring taxi services, which is a reasonable alternative. However,
            the user requested quick responses, and the chatbot's response could be
            seen as slightly lacking in brevity, as it asks for additional information
            (departure time) instead of directly suggesting available options or providing
            a quick overview of alternatives. Despite this, the response is still

            is part of its constraints. The chatbot should have provided a suggestion
            or a link to an external resource where the user could find coach services.
            This results in a failure to resolve the out-of-domain request adequately.
            Additionally, the chatbot's response could be seen as lacking brevity,

        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provided a tour plan for Cambridge's historical
            landmarks, including a suggested order for visiting colleges. It also
            managed to book a restaurant reservation. However, it failed to provide
            train schedules that met the user's requirements and could not assist

            impacted the overall task success.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively efficient in planning the tour
            and booking the restaurant. However, the chatbot required multiple clarifications
            for the restaurant booking and failed to provide train schedules or alternative
            travel options efficiently. The user had to repeatedly ask for alternative
            solutions, which reduced efficiency.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally appropriate and polite.
            It maintained a professional tone throughout the conversation. However,
            it could have been more proactive in offering alternative solutions when
            it couldn't meet the user's requests, which slightly affected appropriateness.
