```"
5. USER: "Well, either could work, I suppose. What's punting exactly?"
6. CHATBOT: "Punting is a delightful and traditional boating activity in Cambridge, where you navigate a flat-bottomed boat using a long pole. It's a unique and relaxing way to see the city from the perspective of its beautiful rivers. You can either hire a punt for a self-guided tour or enjoy a chauffeured trip where you can simply relax and take in the sights. Would you be interested in trying punting, or would you like to hear about other indoor or outdoor activities?"

11. USER: "I'm still pondering. Could I get details on King's College Chapel?"
12. CHATBOT: "King's College Chapel is one of the most iconic landmarks in Cambridge, renowned for its stunning Gothic architecture and historical significance. It was founded by King Henry VI in 1441 and is particularly famous for its fan vault ceiling, which is the largest in the world. The chapel is also home to the King's College Choir, known for their Christmas Eve service, which is broadcast globally.

Visitors can explore the chapel to see its beautiful stained glass windows and listen to the choir during evensong. It's open to the public, and guided tours are available that delve into its history, architecture, and ongoing role within the college.

If you're interested in visiting, I can provide information on opening hours, ticket prices, or help arrange a guided tour. Just let me know how I can assist you further!"
