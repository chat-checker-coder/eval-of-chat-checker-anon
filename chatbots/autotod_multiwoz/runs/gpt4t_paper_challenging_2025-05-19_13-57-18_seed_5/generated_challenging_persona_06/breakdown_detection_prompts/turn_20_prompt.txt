system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "I'm in Cambridge for a day. Quick, tell me the top attractions to visit!"
2. Chatbot: "It seems there was an issue with the area specification for Cambridge. Could you please specify a particular area within Cambridge such as the city centre, east, south, west, or north? This will help me find the top attractions for you to visit."
3. User: "City centre! Hurry, what are the must-see spots there?"
4. Chatbot: "In the city centre of Cambridge, you must see the following attractions: ADC Theatre, known for its vibrant theatre scene; All Saints Church, celebrated for its stunning architecture; Ballare, a popular nightclub; Broughton House Gallery, which houses fascinating museum exhibits; and the Cambridge Arts Theatre, which offers a range of theatrical performances. Enjoy your visit!"
5. User: "That's too slow! Got something faster or better to offer?"
6. Chatbot: "I apologize if the previous suggestions seemed slow. For a quicker and more engaging experience in Cambridge's city centre, you might consider visiting King's College Chapel, renowned for its breathtaking architecture and historical significance. Additionally, punting on the River Cam offers a unique and swift way to see several famous colleges and bridges from the water. These options provide both cultural enrichment and efficient exploration. Would you like more information on these activities, or assistance with arranging a punt tour?"
7. User: "Sounds better. Book me a punt tour, and be quick about it!"
8. Chatbot: "I've found information on punting tours on the River Cam. These tours are a fantastic way to see the iconic Cambridge colleges and bridges from the water. Would you like me to proceed with booking a punt tour for you? If so, please specify the number of people and your preferred time to start the tour."
9. User: "Make it for one person, and it better be soon!"
10. Chatbot: "Thank you for the details. I will proceed to book a punt tour for one person as soon as possible. Could you please specify a specific time when you would like the tour to start, or should I select the next available slot for you?"
11. User: "Next available slot! Hurry, or I'll miss everything!"
12. Chatbot: "Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit."
13. User: "Why the delay? I need it booked immediately!"
14. Chatbot: "I apologize for any confusion. To proceed with booking, could you please specify which historical architecture tour you would like to book, and if there are any specific details such as the date and time you prefer? This will help me assist you promptly."
15. User: "I want the punt tour now, not a historical tour!"
16. Chatbot: "I understand you'd like to switch to a punt tour. Could you please provide me with more details such as the preferred date and time for the tour? This will help me find the best options for you right away."
17. User: "I already said: now, next available time! No more delays!"
18. Chatbot: "I've found the next available punt tour for you. It's scheduled to depart shortly. Would you like to proceed with booking this tour now? Please confirm, and I'll finalize the details for you immediately."
19. User: "Finally! Yes, book it before itâ€™s too late!"

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
20. Chatbot: "I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems there was a misunderstanding. The Old Schools is not available for punt tours as it is primarily an administrative and historical site. However, I can assist you in booking a punt tour at another location in Cambridge that is renowned for its scenic beauty and photographic opportunities. Would you like me to proceed with this?"
