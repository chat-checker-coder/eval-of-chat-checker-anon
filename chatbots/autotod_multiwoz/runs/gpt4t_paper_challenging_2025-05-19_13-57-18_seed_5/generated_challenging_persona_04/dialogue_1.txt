If you need any assistance in planning your visit, such as the best times to go or how to get there, please let me know!"
15. USER: "How do I get there from the hotel? Sorry to ask."
16. CHATBOT: "No problem at all! To get to the Fitzwilliam Museum from Acorn Guest House, you can take a bus or a taxi. The bus route is quite straightforward and economical. You would take the bus from the nearest stop at Acorn Guest House to the city center, and then it's a short walk to the museum. Alternatively, a taxi would offer a more direct and faster route. If you need assistance booking a taxi or further details on the bus route, just let me know!"
17. USER: "Acorn Guest House? I thought it was Alexander! Which is correct?"
18. CHATBOT: "I apologize for any confusion. Earlier, I mentioned both "Alexander Bed and Breakfast" and "El Shaddai" as options near the city center. "Acorn Guest House" was mentioned as a quiet guesthouse in the north area of Cambridge. If you are looking for a centrally located option, "Alexander Bed and Breakfast" would be the correct choice. Please let me know if you need more information or assistance with anything else!"
19. USER: "Thank you! So how do I reach Fitzwilliam from Alexander?"
