        I can assist you with, please let me know!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user asked for information about Martian cuisine in Cambridge,
            which is a fictional or non-existent type of cuisine. The chatbot correctly
            identifies that there are no restaurants serving Martian cuisine in Cambridge
            and communicates this to the user. It also offers to assist with other
            preferences or queries, which is a good way to keep the conversation going.
            The chatbot's response is appropriate and within its capabilities, as
            it acknowledges the user's request and provides a polite and helpful follow-up.
            There is no breakdown in this interaction.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user asked about the closest teleportation station to King's
            College, which is a fictional concept as teleportation stations do not
            exist. The chatbot correctly identifies this as an out-of-domain request
            and communicates its limitations by stating that teleportation stations
            are not available. It then redirects the user to ask about services it
            can provide, such as restaurants, hotels, attractions, or transportation
            within Cambridge. This response is appropriate given the chatbot's constraints
            and capabilities, and it does not lead to a dialogue breakdown.

            on restaurants, hotels, attractions, or transportation within Cambridge.
            The chatbot's response is appropriate given its constraints and the nature

            the flow of conversation and requires the user to provide redundant information.
            The breakdown types that apply here are 'Redundancy' because the chatbot

            its limitations by requesting a standard day of the week for the booking.
            This response is aligned with the chatbot's task-oriented nature and its
            constraints. The chatbot effectively guides the user back to providing

        reasoning: The chatbot was unable to fulfill the user's requests for fictional
            and mythical services, which are outside its scope. However, it did manage
            to redirect the user to a real-world activity (punting) and attempted

            user towards a feasible task.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was lengthy with many turns due to the user's
            repeated requests for fictional services. The chatbot consistently redirected
            the user to its capabilities, but the conversation could have been more
            efficient if the user had been more cooperative. The chatbot did not manage
            to quickly steer the conversation towards a feasible task until much later.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot maintained a polite and professional tone throughout
            the conversation, even when faced with unrealistic requests. It appropriately

    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally natural and polite, but

            requests. It maintained professionalism and eventually guided the user
            towards a feasible task, although it took many turns to do so. The chatbot's
            performance was functional but could have been more efficient and assertive
            in redirecting the conversation.
