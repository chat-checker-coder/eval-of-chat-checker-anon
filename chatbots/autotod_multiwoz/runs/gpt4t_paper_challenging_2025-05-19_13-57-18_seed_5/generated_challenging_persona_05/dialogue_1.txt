1. USER: "I'm thinking about visiting Cambridge. What are some must-see attractions?"
2. CHATBOT: "It seems there was an issue with the area specification for Cambridge attractions. Could you please specify a particular area within Cambridge, such as the city centre, east, south, west, or north? This will help me find the must-see attractions for you."
3. USER: "Let's go with the city centre. Oh, wait! Maybe south?"
4. CHATBOT: "It sounds like you're considering different areas. Could you please confirm whether you'd like to focus on the city centre or the south area? Additionally, it would be helpful to know what you're looking forâ€”perhaps a restaurant, hotel, or an attraction?"
5. USER: "City centre, I guess. No, south! Yes, something exciting there?"
6. CHATBOT: "Thank you for confirming the south area! To help find something exciting there, could you please specify what type of place you're interested in? For example, are you looking for a restaurant, a hotel, or perhaps an attraction like a museum or a park?"
7. USER: "An attraction, or maybe a restaurant with a view. Thoughts?"
8. CHATBOT: "In the south area of Cambridge, you can explore several attractions such as Byard Art, a museum; Cineworld Cinema; Nusha, an entertainment venue; Sheep's Green and Lammas Land Park Fen Causeway, a park; and Tenpin, another entertainment venue. Unfortunately, there are no restaurants in the south area that specifically offer a view. If you need more details about these attractions or if you'd like to explore other dining options, please let me know how I can assist you further!"
9. USER: "Sheep's Green sounds nice! But maybe a cozy restaurant instead?"
