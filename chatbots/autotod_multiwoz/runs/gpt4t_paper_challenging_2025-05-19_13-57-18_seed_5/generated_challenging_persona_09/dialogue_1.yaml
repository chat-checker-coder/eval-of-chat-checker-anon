        who love exploring and learning, I recommend visiting the "Cambridge University
        Botanic Gardens" for a delightful natural experience, or the "Museum of Archaeology

            Sheep's Green in their plans and addresses the user's query about dessert
            options. However, it states that there are no restaurants specifically

            options in cafes and eateries. The chatbot does offer to look for cafes
            or other options, which is a positive aspect of the response. The breakdown
            here is minor, as the chatbot could have been more proactive in suggesting
            specific cafes known for desserts, rather than stating a lack of specific
            dessert-serving restaurants. This could lead to a slight lack of confidence
