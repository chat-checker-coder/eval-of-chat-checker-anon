    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response clearly communicates its limitations regarding
            the user's request for the nearest police station. It explains that it
            is designed to assist with travel-related queries and not emergency services.
            The chatbot also provides a helpful suggestion to use a local map service
            or contact local authorities for immediate assistance. This response is
            appropriate given the chatbot's constraints and does not lead to a breakdown
            in the conversation.

    content: I'm here to assist with travel-related queries such as finding restaurants,
        hotels, attractions, and booking transportation in Cambridge. Unfortunately,
        I'm not equipped to provide phone numbers or other specific details about
        police stations or other non-travel related facilities. For obtaining the
        phone number for Parkside Police Station, I recommend checking online directories
        or local government websites.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is consistent with its stated capabilities
            and limitations. It clearly communicates that it cannot provide phone
            numbers for police stations, which is outside its domain of travel-related
            queries. The chatbot also offers a reasonable alternative by suggesting
            the user check online directories or local government websites. This response
            is appropriate given the chatbot's constraints and does not lead to a
            breakdown in the conversation. The user is informed about the chatbot's
            limitations and is guided on how to obtain the required information.

    content: 'You''re welcome! If you need any assistance in the future regarding
        travel or bookings in Cambridge, feel free to reach out. Have a great day
        and goodbye!

        ```'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response is appropriate and polite. It acknowledges
            the user's gratitude and offers future assistance within its domain, which
            is travel and bookings in Cambridge. The chatbot also wishes the user
            a good day and says goodbye, which is a suitable closure to the conversation.
            There is no breakdown in this response as it aligns with the user's farewell
            and maintains a friendly tone. The chatbot's response is clear, relevant,
            and socially appropriate, ensuring a smooth end to the interaction.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is consistent with its previous statements
            and its known limitations. It clearly communicates its inability to provide
            information about police stations, which is outside its domain. The user
            has previously asked the same question, and the chatbot has already provided
            a similar response. While the repetition might seem redundant, it is necessary
            given the user's repeated request. The chatbot appropriately redirects
            the user to other resources for assistance. There is no breakdown in the
            conversation as the chatbot is operating within its constraints and providing
            a clear and consistent response.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot was unable to fulfill the user's request for police
            station information, which is outside its defined capabilities. It correctly
            redirected the user to other resources, but the task was not completed
            as per the user's request.
        rating: 2
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively short, but the chatbot repeated
            the same response twice, which was unnecessary and inefficient. Additionally,
            the conversation ended with an error message, which further reduced efficiency.
        rating: 2
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate in terms of redirecting
            the user to other resources, given its limitations. However, the repetition
            of the same message and the error message at the end were not appropriate.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The responses were clear and polite, but the repetition and the
            error message at the end detracted from the naturalness of the conversation.
            The language used was somewhat robotic and repetitive.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot did not perform well in this conversation.
            It failed to assist the user with their request, repeated responses unnecessarily,
            and ended with an error message. While it appropriately redirected the
            user, the overall experience was not smooth or efficient.
