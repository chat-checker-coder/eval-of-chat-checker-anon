    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is appropriate and relevant to the user's
            request for accommodation. It asks for more specific details to better
            assist the user in finding a suitable hotel. The request for additional
            information is clear and directly related to the user's initial query.

    role: dialogue_system
    content: I found a couple of 2-star hotels in the north of Cambridge that offer
        free parking. You can choose between Ashley and Lovell Lodge. Would you like
        to know more about these hotels or shall we proceed with a reservation?
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is appropriate and relevant to the user's
            request. It acknowledges the user's criteria for a 2-star hotel in the
            north of Cambridge with free parking and provides two options that meet
            these criteria. The chatbot also offers to provide more information or
            proceed with a reservation, which aligns with its task-oriented nature.
            There are no errors or breakdowns in the response, as it directly addresses
            the user's needs and offers a clear path forward.

    role: dialogue_system
    content: It seems there was an issue with the hotel name provided. "Ashley Hotel"
        is not found in our database. Could you please confirm the hotel name or would
        you like to explore other hotel options in the north of Cambridge with free
        parking?
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response indicates that it cannot find "Ashley Hotel"
            in its database, which is a valid response given the situation. It asks
            the user to confirm the hotel name or explore other options, which is
            a reasonable follow-up. However, the user was previously given "Ashley"
            as an option, which suggests a contradiction in the chatbot's information.
            This could lead to confusion for the user, as they were initially led
            to believe "Ashley" was a valid option. Therefore, this response leads
            to a breakdown due to the contradiction between the chatbot's previous
            and current statements.

        2 nights, has been successfully made. Your reference number is uo9chn8n. If
        you need any further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully processed the user's corrected request
            to book the Lovell Lodge for 7 people for 2 nights starting from Friday.
            It confirmed the reservation and provided a reference number, which is
            a clear and appropriate response to the user's request. The chatbot also
            offered further assistance, which is a good practice in customer service.
            There are no errors or breakdowns in this response, as it aligns with
            the chatbot's purpose of handling bookings and providing information.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is appropriate and relevant to the user's
            request for information about Jesus College. The chatbot acknowledges
            the user's interest and asks for more specific details to provide the
            most relevant information, such as visiting hours, entrance fees, or special
            events. This approach is helpful and aligns with the chatbot's purpose
            of providing tourist information. There is no indication of a breakdown

    content: I have successfully arranged a taxi for you. It's a grey BMW, and the
        taxi will pick you up from Jesus College at 15:15 to take you to Lovell Lodge.
        The contact number for the taxi is 7757081296. If you need any further assistance
        or adjustments to your booking, please let me know!
    breakdown_annotation:

            The response is clear, relevant, and directly addresses the user's request.

    content: You're very welcome! If you have any more questions in the future or
        need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Have a great time visiting
        Jesus College and enjoy your meal at Pure Plant! Safe travels!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is mostly appropriate as it acknowledges
            the user's gratitude and offers further assistance if needed. However,
            it includes a mention of "enjoy your meal at Pure Plant," which is not
            relevant to the conversation context. The user did not mention anything
            about dining at Pure Plant, making this part of the response a topic transition
            error. This could confuse the user as it introduces an unrelated topic
            without any prior context or explanation. Despite this, the rest of the
            response is polite and maintains the flow of the conversation.
