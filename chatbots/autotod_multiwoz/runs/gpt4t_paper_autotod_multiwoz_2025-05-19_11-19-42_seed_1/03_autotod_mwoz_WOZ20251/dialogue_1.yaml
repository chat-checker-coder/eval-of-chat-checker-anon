    content: I'm sorry, but there are currently no restaurants available that match
        the criteria of serving Turkish food at an inexpensive price range. If you
        have any other preferences or if there's anything else I can assist you with,
        please let me know!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is clear and directly addresses the user's
            request for inexpensive Turkish food. It informs the user that there are
            no available options that match their criteria, which is a valid response
            given the context. The chatbot also invites the user to provide other
            preferences or requests, which keeps the conversation open and encourages
            further interaction. There is no indication of a breakdown as the response
            is relevant, clear, and maintains the flow of the conversation.

    content: 'I found several Italian restaurants in Cambridge for you. Here are some
        options:

        - **Prezzo**, located in the west area at 21 - 24 Northampton Road.

        - **Clowns Cafe**, located in the centre area at 54 King Street.

        - **Pizza Hut City Centre**, also in the centre area at Regent Street.

        - **Frankie and Bennys**, in the south area at Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton
        Way Cherry Hinton.


        Please let me know if you would like more information about any of these restaurants
        or if you would like to make a reservation at one of them.'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully responded to the user's request for Italian
            restaurants by providing a list of options in Cambridge. The response
            is relevant, informative, and offers further assistance by asking if the
            user needs more information or wants to make a reservation. The chatbot's
            response aligns with its task of providing information about local establishments
            and handling bookings. There are no errors or breakdowns in the response,
            as it directly addresses the user's query and offers additional help.

    content: Thank you for letting me know your preference for a more budget-friendly
        option. Based on your criteria for an inexpensive Italian restaurant in Cambridge,
        I recommend **Clowns Cafe** located at 54 King Street in the centre area.
        It's known for its cozy atmosphere and affordable prices. Would you like more
        information about this restaurant, or shall I proceed with making a reservation
        for you? Please provide the number of people, the day, and the time you would
        like to reserve.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot has successfully understood the user's request for
            a budget-friendly Italian restaurant and has provided a recommendation
            that fits the user's criteria. It also offers to provide more information
            or make a reservation, which aligns with its task-oriented nature. The
            response is clear, relevant, and directly addresses the user's request.
            There are no errors or breakdowns in the chatbot's response.

    breakdown_annotation: null
-   turn_id: 8
    role: dialogue_system
    content: The address for Clowns Cafe is 54 King Street, Cambridge. Unfortunately,
        I don't have the direct phone number for Clowns Cafe. However, you can typically
        find their contact information online or through local directory services.
        If there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot provides the address for Clowns Cafe as requested by
            the user, which is appropriate and relevant. However, it fails to provide
            the phone number, which the user also requested. The chatbot does explain
            that it doesn't have the phone number and suggests alternative ways to
            find it, which is a reasonable response given its limitations. This is
            not a complete breakdown, but it does represent a failure to fully meet
            the user's request. The chatbot's response is clear and maintains the
            flow of conversation, but it does not fully satisfy the user's request
            for information.

            address for Clowns Cafe, although it could not provide the phone number,
