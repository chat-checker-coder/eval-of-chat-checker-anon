    content: 'I found several colleges in Cambridge that you might like to visit.
        Here are some options: Christ''s College on Saint Andrew''s Street, Corpus
        Christi on King''s Parade, Downing College on Regent Street, Emmanuel College
        on Saint Andrew''s Street, and Gonville and Caius College on Trinity Street.
        Please let me know if you need more information about any of these colleges
        or if you want directions to a specific one.'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response is relevant and informative, providing a
            list of colleges in Cambridge that the user might be interested in visiting.
            It also offers further assistance by asking if the user needs more information
            or directions to a specific college. This aligns well with the user's
            request for help in finding a college to visit. The response is clear,
            concise, and directly addresses the user's query without any errors or
            omissions. Therefore, there is no dialogue breakdown in this interaction.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot initially provided a list of colleges, which was relevant
            to the user's request. However, it failed to provide the specific information
            requested about Christ's College, such as entrance fee, postcode, and
            address, due to an error. This significantly impacted the task success
            as the user's query was not fully addressed.
        rating: 2
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was short, but the chatbot's error in the second
            response meant that the user did not receive the information they needed,
            leading to inefficiency. The user would need to ask again or seek information
            elsewhere.
        rating: 2
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The initial response was appropriate and informative, listing several
            colleges. However, the error message 'chatbot_error' in response to a
            specific query was inappropriate and unhelpful, as it did not guide the
            user on what to do next or offer an alternative solution.
        rating: 2
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The initial response was natural and informative. However, the
            error message 'chatbot_error' is not a natural or user-friendly response,
            which detracts from the overall naturalness of the interaction.
        rating: 2
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: The chatbot started well by providing a list of colleges, but it
            failed to deliver on the user's specific request due to an error. This
            significantly impacted the overall performance, as the user did not receive
            the necessary information and was left without guidance on how to proceed.
