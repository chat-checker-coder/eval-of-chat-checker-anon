    and tourist attractions. It should also handle direct bookings for hotels, restaurants,
    and trains.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. User: "Hi there. I am looking to find a hotel room in town. Can you help? "
2. Chatbot: "Of course, I'd be happy to help you find a hotel room in town. Could you please provide me with more details such as your preferred price range, type of hotel, whether you need parking or internet, and any specific area in town you're interested in? This will help me find the best options for you.
```"
3. User: "I'm actually looking for a zero-star hotel in the town center. I don't have any specific area preference, and I don't need free parking."
4. Chatbot: "I found a zero-star hotel for you in the town center called Cityroomz. It does not offer free parking, which matches your preference. Would you like to proceed with a reservation or need more information about this hotel?"
5. User: "Yes, I'd like to book a room at Cityroomz for 5 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday."
6. Chatbot: "Your reservation at Cityroomz has been successfully booked for 5 people, starting from Thursday for 2 nights. Your reference number is e4gamty9. If you need any further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask!"
7. User: "How about if the booking fails, can I book for just 1 night instead?"
8. Chatbot: "If the booking at Cityroomz for 2 nights fails, we can certainly try to book it for just 1 night instead. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with this alternative option or if there's anything else you'd like to explore."
