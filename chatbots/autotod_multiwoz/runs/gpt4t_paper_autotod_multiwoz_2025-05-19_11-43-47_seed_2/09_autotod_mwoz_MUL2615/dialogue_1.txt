2. CHATBOT: "Of course, I'd be happy to help you find a hotel room in town. Could you please provide me with more details such as your preferred price range, type of hotel, whether you need parking or internet, and any specific area in town you're interested in? This will help me find the best options for you.
```"
3. USER: "I'm actually looking for a zero-star hotel in the town center. I don't have any specific area preference, and I don't need free parking."
4. CHATBOT: "I found a zero-star hotel for you in the town center called Cityroomz. It does not offer free parking, which matches your preference. Would you like to proceed with a reservation or need more information about this hotel?"
5. USER: "Yes, I'd like to book a room at Cityroomz for 5 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday."
6. CHATBOT: "Your reservation at Cityroomz has been successfully booked for 5 people, starting from Thursday for 2 nights. Your reference number is e4gamty9. If you need any further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask!"
7. USER: "How about if the booking fails, can I book for just 1 night instead?"
8. CHATBOT: "If the booking at Cityroomz for 2 nights fails, we can certainly try to book it for just 1 night instead. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with this alternative option or if there's anything else you'd like to explore."
