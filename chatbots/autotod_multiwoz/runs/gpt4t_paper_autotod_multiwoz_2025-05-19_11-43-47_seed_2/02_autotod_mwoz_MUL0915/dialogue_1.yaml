    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provided a list of expensive restaurants
            in Cambridge and made a reservation at Midsummer House. It also provided
            recommendations for places with interesting architecture. However, it
            failed to provide the phone number and address of King's College Chapel,
            which is a significant task failure.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was efficient in terms of providing restaurant
            options and making a reservation. However, the final request for contact
            information resulted in an error, which could lead to additional user
            effort to resolve.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The responses were mostly appropriate and relevant to the user's
            requests. The error message 'chatbot_error' was inappropriate and unhelpful,
            reducing the overall appropriateness of the interaction.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The responses were generally natural and conversational, except
            for the abrupt and unnatural 'chatbot_error' message, which detracted
            from the overall naturalness of the interaction.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: The chatbot performed well in providing restaurant options and
            making a reservation, but the failure to provide contact information for
            King's College Chapel and the error message significantly impacted the
            overall performance.
