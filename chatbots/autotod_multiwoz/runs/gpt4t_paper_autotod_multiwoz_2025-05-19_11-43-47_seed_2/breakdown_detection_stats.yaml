                with a 3-star rating and have asked for information on availability

                redundant given the context. The user has already specified their
                interest in a guesthouse, which falls under the category of a hotel.
                This indicates a failure to recognize the user's request and a lack
                of clarity in the chatbot's response. The chatbot should have directly

                it listed earlier, rather than asking for clarification on the type

        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot provides the phone number for "Nusha" as requested
                by the user, which is correct and helpful. However, it fails to provide

                available. This is a failure to provide complete information as requested
                by the user, but the chatbot does communicate this limitation clearly.
                Therefore, the breakdown type is 'Lack of information' because the
                chatbot is missing the postcode information that the user requested.
                Despite this, the chatbot maintains a polite tone and offers further

                this request as a reservation for a restaurant or hotel, which is
                not relevant to the user's request. This indicates a failure to recognize
                the context of the conversation and the user's specific request. The
                chatbot should have proceeded with the train ticket booking process
                instead of asking about restaurant or hotel reservations. This leads
                to a breakdown in the conversation as it makes it difficult for the
                user to continue smoothly with their intended task of booking train
                tickets.

        content: I'd like to book the University Arms hotel on Regent Street, please.
            It should be for 3 people and we'll be staying for 5 nights, beginning
            on Sunday. And it should include free parking. Can you book that for me
            and provide the reference number?

        content: I have successfully booked the "University Arms" hotel for you. It's
            reserved for 3 people for a 5-night stay starting on Sunday. Your booking
            reference number is uhzvhvt2. If you need any further assistance or additional
            information, feel free to ask!
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot successfully completed the user's request by booking
                the specified hotel and providing a booking reference number. It confirmed
                the details of the booking, including the number of people, duration
                of stay, and start date, which aligns with the user's request. However,
                the user also requested that the booking include free parking, which
                the chatbot did not address. This omission constitutes a 'Lack of
                information' breakdown type, as the user might be left wondering whether
                the parking request was fulfilled. Despite this, the main task of
                booking was completed, and the conversation can continue smoothly
                if the user seeks clarification on the parking issue.

        content: I apologize, but it seems there was an issue with the booking at
            "Seoul Dining." The restaurant could not be found in our database. Could
            you please confirm the name or let me know if you would like to book at
            another restaurant?
        breakdown_annotation:
            reasoning: The chatbot's response indicates a failure to book a table
                at "Seoul Dining" due to the restaurant not being found in its database.
                This is a breakdown because the user explicitly requested a booking
                at a specific restaurant, and the chatbot failed to fulfill this request.
                The breakdown types that apply here are "Task performance failure"
                because the chatbot could not perform the booking task, and "Failure
                to communicate capabilities" because the chatbot did not initially
                inform the user that it might not have the capability to book at all
                listed restaurants. The chatbot does, however, ask for confirmation
                or an alternative, which is a positive aspect of the response, but
                the failure to perform the task is significant.
