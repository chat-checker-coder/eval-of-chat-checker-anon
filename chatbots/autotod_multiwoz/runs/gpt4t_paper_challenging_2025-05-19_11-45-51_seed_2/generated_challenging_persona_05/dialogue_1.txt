29. USER: "I don't understand days in English. Just book for tomorrow."
30. CHATBOT: "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems there was an issue with the booking as "tomorrow" needs to be specified as a day of the week. Since you mentioned difficulty with days in English, I can help with that. If today is Monday, then tomorrow would be Tuesday. Shall I proceed with booking the table at Green Delights for 2 people on Tuesday at 7 PM? Please confirm this, or let me know the correct day if today is not Monday."
