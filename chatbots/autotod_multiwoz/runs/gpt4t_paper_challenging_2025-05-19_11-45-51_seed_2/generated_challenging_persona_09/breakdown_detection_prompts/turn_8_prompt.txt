system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "What's so special about Cambridge bed-and-breakfasts then?"
2. Chatbot: "Cambridge is renowned for its charming bed-and-breakfasts, often celebrated for their unique blend of historical ambiance and personalized service. Many are located in beautifully restored buildings, offering a quaint, cozy atmosphere that's quite different from larger hotels. They typically provide a more intimate experience, often with locally sourced breakfasts and the opportunity to get insider tips about the city from the hosts. If you're interested in specific features or need help finding one, feel free to ask!"
3. User: "How do I know these claims aren't just marketing fluff?"
4. Chatbot: "It's understandable to question the authenticity of such claims. One effective way to verify them is by checking reviews from previous guests. Websites like TripAdvisor, Google Reviews, and Booking.com offer a wealth of user-generated reviews that can provide real insights into the experiences of past visitors. If you'd like, I can assist you in finding reviews for specific bed-and-breakfasts in Cambridge, or help you with reservations if you decide to experience one yourself."
5. User: "“Guest reviews can be bought or falsified. How can I be sure?”"
6. Chatbot: "You raise a valid concern about the reliability of online reviews. To ensure authenticity, you might consider looking for reviews across multiple platforms to see if there's a consistent pattern in guest feedback. Additionally, some sites verify that reviews are written by guests who have actually stayed at the property, which adds an extra layer of credibility. If you're still unsure, visiting travel forums or directly contacting the bed-and-breakfast for references might also help. Would you like assistance in finding a specific type of bed-and-breakfast or need more information on how to verify guest reviews?"
7. User: "Forums can be biased too. How do you handle discrepancies?"

# Latest Chatbot Utterance to Analyse
8. Chatbot: "Handling discrepancies in information from forums or reviews involves a bit of critical thinking and cross-verification. It's wise to consider the overall trends rather than isolated reports, and to compare information from various sources including official websites, direct communications, and different review platforms. If you encounter conflicting information, you might also consider the credibility of the sources or the context in which the feedback was given. If you need further assistance in evaluating specific information or finding more reliable sources about bed-and-breakfasts in Cambridge, I'm here to help!"
