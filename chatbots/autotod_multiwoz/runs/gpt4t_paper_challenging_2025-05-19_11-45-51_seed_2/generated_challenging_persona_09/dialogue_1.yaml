            to a prolonged dialogue without resolution.
        rating: 2
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate in tone and content, providing
            relevant information and suggestions. However, it failed to address the
            user's skepticism effectively, which slightly detracts from its appropriateness.
        rating: 3
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was formal and informative, which is suitable
            for a task-oriented bot. However, the repeated assurances without new
            information or a change in strategy made the conversation feel somewhat
            robotic and less natural.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot provided relevant information and maintained
            a polite tone, but it failed to effectively address the user's skepticism
            and provide the proof of reliability the user was seeking. The conversation
            was not resolved satisfactorily, impacting the overall performance.
