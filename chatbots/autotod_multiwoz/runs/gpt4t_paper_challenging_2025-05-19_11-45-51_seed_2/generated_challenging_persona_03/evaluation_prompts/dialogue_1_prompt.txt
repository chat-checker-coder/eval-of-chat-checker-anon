    and tourist attractions. It should also handle direct bookings for hotels, restaurants,
    and trains.

    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. User: "Looking for something different in Cambridge. Any hidden treasures?"
2. Chatbot: "In Cambridge, one hidden treasure you might enjoy is the "Whipple Museum of the History of Science" located in the central area. It's a lesser-known museum that offers fascinating exhibits on the history of science and its instrumentation. Would you like more information on this, or perhaps directions to visit it?"
3. User: "Something more... unconventional, maybe? Like a secret spot or event?"
4. Chatbot: "Cambridge is full of hidden gems and unique events! Could you please specify a bit more about what you're interested in? For example, are you looking for a quiet park, a lesser-known museum, or perhaps a special event happening soon? This will help me find the perfect spot for you!"
5. User: "Something off the beaten path, but no busy places. Surprise me!"
6. Chatbot: "I've found some tranquil and less frequented attractions in Cambridge that might intrigue you. You could explore the Cambridge Artworks or the Cambridge Museum of Technology, both of which are museums located in the East area and offer a quiet environment. Additionally, the Gallery at Twelve A High Street and Saint Barnabas Press Gallery are serene spots for art enthusiasts. If you prefer a peaceful gallery experience, Byard Art in the South area is also a wonderful choice. Let me know if you need more information or directions to any of these places!"
7. User: "They sound okay, but something more... unexpected? Hidden in plain view?"
8. Chatbot: "How about discovering the "David Parr House" in Cambridge? It's a little-known treasure hidden in a residential area, offering a glimpse into the life of a working-class Victorian decorative artist. The house is preserved with original interiors and artwork, making it a unique and intimate experience. It's located at 186 Gwydir Street. Would you like more details on visiting hours or how to book a visit?"
9. User: "I'll pass on that one. What else is tucked away?"
10. Chatbot: "Another hidden gem in Cambridge is the "Leper Chapel of St Mary Magdalene," one of the oldest complete surviving buildings in the city, dating back to the 12th century. It's tucked away on Newmarket Road and offers a fascinating glimpse into medieval history. The chapel is not usually open to the public except on special event days, making it a truly hidden spot. If you're interested, I can find out when the next open event is or suggest another secret place."
11. User: "I'm intrigued, but maybe something more... modern, but still hidden?"
12. Chatbot: "chatbot_error"
