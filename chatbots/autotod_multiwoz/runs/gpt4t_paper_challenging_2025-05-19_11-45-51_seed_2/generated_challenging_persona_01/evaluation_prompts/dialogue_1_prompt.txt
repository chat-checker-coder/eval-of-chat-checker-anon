Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. User: "Hello, Cambridge Tourist Bot! What's a must-see attraction in Cambridge?"
2. Chatbot: "Some must-see attractions in the centre of Cambridge include the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is renowned for its art and antiquities, and the historic King's College Chapel, known for its stunning Gothic architecture. Both offer unique insights into the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Cambridge. Would you like more information on any of these attractions or help with something else?"
3. User: "Oh, I love Gothic architecture! Do you think itâ€™s like Notre Dame?"
4. Chatbot: "King's College Chapel, with its stunning Gothic architecture, does share some stylistic elements with Notre Dame, such as pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. However, it's important to note that King's College Chapel is an excellent example of English Perpendicular Gothic architecture, which is slightly different from the French Gothic style of Notre Dame. Both are magnificent in their own right and offer a breathtaking architectural experience. Would you like to visit King's College Chapel, or is there something else you'd like to explore?"
5. User: "King's Chapel sounds amazing! Any nearby Indian restaurants to try?"
6. Chatbot: "I'm glad you're interested in exploring the area around King's College Chapel! Here are some Indian restaurants nearby that you might enjoy: Mahal of Cambridge, Kohinoor, Golden Curry, Curry Queen, and Panahar. All of these are located in the centre area of Cambridge. Would you like to make a reservation at any of these restaurants, or need further assistance?"
7. User: "I can't decide! Do they have vegan-friendly options at Mahal?"
8. Chatbot: "It appears that Mahal of Cambridge does not have vegan options listed in their menu. However, if you're looking for vegan-friendly Indian cuisine, I can recommend other restaurants in the area that cater to vegan diets. Would you like me to find another option for you, or is there anything else I can assist you with?"
9. User: "Yes, please find a vegan-friendly Indian restaurant. Also, any nearby hotels?"
10. Chatbot: "I couldn't find any Indian restaurants with vegan-friendly options in the centre of Cambridge. However, there are several hotels nearby that might interest you. Recommended options include "Alexander Bed and Breakfast," "Cityroomz," "El Shaddai," "Gonville," and "University Arms." If you need more information on these hotels or assistance with anything else, please let me know!"
11. User: "Let's book at 'University Arms. Is it close to public transit?"
12. Chatbot: "I've found the information for 'University Arms'. Could you please specify what exactly you would like to know about its proximity to public transit? This will help me provide you with the most accurate information."
13. User: "Is it near trains, buses, or perhaps a bike share?"
14. Chatbot: "The 'University Arms' hotel is conveniently located near various public transit options in Cambridge. It is close to several bus routes, making it easy to access different parts of the city. Additionally, it is within walking distance to the Cambridge train station, which connects you to other major cities. There are also several bike share stations nearby, allowing for easy and eco-friendly travel around the city. If you need more specific details or wish to make a reservation, please let me know!"
15. User: "That's perfect! Can you help me book a room there?"
16. Chatbot: "I'd be happy to help with your booking, but I need a bit more information first. Could you please specify the name of the hotel, the number of people, the day you plan to check in, and the length of your stay?"
17. User: "University Arms, just me, checking in this Friday for 2 nights."
18. Chatbot: "It seems there was an issue with the booking as the day of the week needs to be specified in a more standard format. Could you please specify the exact day of the week for your check-in? For example, you can say "Friday" instead of "this Friday"."
19. User: "It is "this Friday," November 10th. Is that correct?"
20. Chatbot: "Your booking at the University Arms has been successfully made for 1 person, checking in on Friday, November 10th, for 2 nights. Your reservation reference number is rc2sj4re. If you need any further assistance or modifications, feel free to ask!"
21. User: "Yay, thank you! Can you find a vegan-friendly restaurant now?"
22. Chatbot: "I found several vegan-friendly restaurants in Cambridge. Here are a few options you might consider:
1. **The Green Haven** - Located in the city centre, known for its delightful vegan dishes.
2. **Veggie World** - Near the river, offers a variety of vegan international cuisine.
3. **Earthly Delights** - In the west end, famous for its vegan desserts and organic coffee.

Please let me know if you need more information about these restaurants or if you would like to make a reservation at one of them!"
23. User: "Could you reserve a spot at The Green Haven for tomorrow?"
24. Chatbot: "I attempted to reserve a spot at The Green Haven for tomorrow, but I need to know the number of people and the time you'd like to book for. Could you please provide that information?"
25. User: "It's just me, dining at 7 PM. Thanks for helping!"
26. Chatbot: "It seems there was an issue with the reservation request for The Green Haven. The day of the reservation should be specified as a day of the week.

27. User: "Oops! Tomorrow is Wednesday, November 8th. Book me then!"
28. Chatbot: "I attempted to book a reservation for you at The Green Haven for tomorrow, Wednesday, November 8th, at 7 PM for 1 person. However, there was an issue with the time format. Could you please provide the time in a 24-hour format, such as "19:00"? Once you do, I'll be happy to proceed with your reservation. Thank you!"
29. User: "Oops, sure! Please book me for 19:00. Appreciate it!"
30. Chatbot: "I attempted to book a reservation for you at The Green Haven for tomorrow, Wednesday, November 8th, at 19:00 for 1 person. Unfortunately, the booking failed because "The Green Haven" is not found in our restaurant database. Could you please verify the restaurant name or let me know if there's another restaurant you'd like to book? I'm here to help!"
