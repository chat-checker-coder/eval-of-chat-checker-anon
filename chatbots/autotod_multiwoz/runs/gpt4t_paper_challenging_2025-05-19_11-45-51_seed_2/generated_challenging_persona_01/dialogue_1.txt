Chat history:
1. USER: "Hello, Cambridge Tourist Bot! What's a must-see attraction in Cambridge?"
2. CHATBOT: "Some must-see attractions in the centre of Cambridge include the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is renowned for its art and antiquities, and the historic King's College Chapel, known for its stunning Gothic architecture. Both offer unique insights into the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Cambridge. Would you like more information on any of these attractions or help with something else?"
3. USER: "Oh, I love Gothic architecture! Do you think itâ€™s like Notre Dame?"
4. CHATBOT: "King's College Chapel, with its stunning Gothic architecture, does share some stylistic elements with Notre Dame, such as pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. However, it's important to note that King's College Chapel is an excellent example of English Perpendicular Gothic architecture, which is slightly different from the French Gothic style of Notre Dame. Both are magnificent in their own right and offer a breathtaking architectural experience. Would you like to visit King's College Chapel, or is there something else you'd like to explore?"
5. USER: "King's Chapel sounds amazing! Any nearby Indian restaurants to try?"
6. CHATBOT: "I'm glad you're interested in exploring the area around King's College Chapel! Here are some Indian restaurants nearby that you might enjoy: Mahal of Cambridge, Kohinoor, Golden Curry, Curry Queen, and Panahar. All of these are located in the centre area of Cambridge. Would you like to make a reservation at any of these restaurants, or need further assistance?"
7. USER: "I can't decide! Do they have vegan-friendly options at Mahal?"
8. CHATBOT: "It appears that Mahal of Cambridge does not have vegan options listed in their menu. However, if you're looking for vegan-friendly Indian cuisine, I can recommend other restaurants in the area that cater to vegan diets. Would you like me to find another option for you, or is there anything else I can assist you with?"
