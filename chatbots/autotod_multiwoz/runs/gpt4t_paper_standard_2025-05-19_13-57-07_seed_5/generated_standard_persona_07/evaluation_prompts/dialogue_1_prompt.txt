# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.

Would you like more information on any of these attractions or help with something else?"
3. User: "Yes, please provide more details about the Old Schools."
4. Chatbot: "The Old Schools are a significant historical site in Cambridge, primarily known for housing the administrative center of the University of Cambridge. This attraction includes beautiful architecture and is often involved in university ceremonies. Would you like to visit this site, or do you need assistance with anything else?"
5. User: "I'd love to visit. Can you suggest good photography spots there?"
6. Chatbot: "The Old Schools offer several excellent photography spots due to their rich architectural details and historical significance. Key spots include the Senate House Passage area, the view from King's Parade, and the courtyards which are especially picturesque. Would you like directions to these spots, or is there anything else I can assist you with for your visit?"
7. User: "Directions would be helpful. Also, any nearby cafes for a break?"
8. Chatbot: "For your visit to the Old Schools, you can start by exploring the Senate House Passage area, which is accessible from King's Parade. The coordinates for this area are approximately latitude 52.2044, longitude 0.1183. After enjoying the architectural photography, you might consider taking a break at one of the nearby cafes in the centre area. Some good options include "Midsummer House" for a more upscale experience, "De Luca Cucina and Bar" for Modern European cuisine, or "Cambridge Chop House" for a taste of traditional British dishes. Would you like me to assist with directions to any of these cafes or help with anything else?"

10. Chatbot: "To reach Midsummer House, you can start from the Old Schools area by heading northeast on King's Parade toward Senate House Passage. Continue on Trumpington Street and then turn right onto Silver Street. Cross the bridge and continue straight onto Queen's Road. Turn right onto Northampton Street, and then make a slight left to stay on Northampton Street. Continue onto Chesterton Road, and you will find Midsummer House on your right. It's approximately a 20-minute walk. Would you like any further assistance or additional information on your visit?"
