If you'd like, I can assist you with booking taxis for your group. Please provide me with the departure location, destination, and either the desired leave time or the time you need to arrive. If you prefer a coach, I recommend contacting local coach services directly as they can accommodate larger groups and may offer special arrangements for school trips.
