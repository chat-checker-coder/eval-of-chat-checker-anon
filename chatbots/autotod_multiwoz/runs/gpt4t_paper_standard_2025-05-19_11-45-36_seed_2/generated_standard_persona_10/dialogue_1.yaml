            have directly provided the opening hours for Clare College Gardens or
            acknowledged its inability to do so. Instead, it asks the user to specify
            the name of the place again, which is redundant and indicates a failure
            to update information based on the user's previous input. This results
            in a breakdown due to redundancy and information update failure.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has already specified that they are interested in booking
            a dinner at Oak Bistro. The chatbot's response asking for the name of
            the restaurant is redundant because the user has already provided this
            information. This indicates a redundancy breakdown. However, the chatbot
            correctly asks for additional necessary details such as the number of
            people, day, and time, which are relevant for making a reservation. Therefore,
            while there is a breakdown due to redundancy, the conversation can still
            proceed smoothly once the user provides the additional details.

        The day of the reservation should be specified as a day of the week. Could

        For example, you can say "Wednesday" instead of "tomorrow."
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's response indicates a need for clarification regarding
            the reservation date. The user specified "tomorrow," which is a valid
            way to indicate a date, but the chatbot requests a specific day of the
            week instead. This could be seen as a lack of flexibility in understanding
            common expressions of time, leading to a clarification failure. The chatbot
            should have been able to interpret "tomorrow" as the next day from the
            current date. This creates a minor disruption in the flow of conversation,
            as the user now needs to provide additional information that should have
            been inferred by the chatbot.

    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response indicates a misunderstanding of the
            user's input. The user clearly specified "7 PM" as the reservation time,
            which is a valid and commonly understood time format. The chatbot's request
            for a different time format ("08:30 PM") is unnecessary and could confuse
            the user, as "7 PM" is already clear and unambiguous. This leads to a
            dialogue breakdown as it disrupts the flow of conversation and may frustrate
            the user. The breakdown types applicable here are "Clarification failure"
            because the chatbot is asking for clarification on something that was
            already clear, and "Lack of clarity" because the chatbot's request for
