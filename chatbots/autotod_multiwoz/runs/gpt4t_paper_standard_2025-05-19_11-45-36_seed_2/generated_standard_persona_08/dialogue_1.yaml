        reasoning: The chatbot's response is appropriate and relevant to the user's
            request. It acknowledges the user's request to book a restaurant and asks
            for additional necessary details to proceed with the booking. The response
            is clear, polite, and directly addresses the user's needs without any
            errors or omissions. There is no indication of a breakdown in the conversation
            as the chatbot is performing its task effectively by gathering required
            information to assist the user further.

        Please let me know which restaurant you would like to book, or if you need
        more information about any of these options!'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot has successfully provided a list of Italian restaurants
            in Cambridge that match the user's preferences for a mid-range price.
            The response is clear, relevant, and directly addresses the user's request
            for restaurant options. The chatbot also offers to provide more information
            if needed, which is helpful and shows consideration for the user's needs.
            There is no indication of any breakdown types such as ignoring the request,
            providing wrong information, or any other errors. The conversation can
            continue smoothly as the user can now choose from the provided options
            or ask for more details.

    content: It seems there was an issue with the time format for the reservation
        at Prezzo. Could you please specify the time in a format like "08:30 PM"?
        Once you provide the correct format, I'll be happy to complete the booking
        for you!
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The chatbot's latest response indicates a problem with the time
            format provided by the user. The user specified "7 PM," which is a common
            and understandable time format. The chatbot's request for a different
            format ("08:30 PM") is unnecessary and could confuse the user, as the
            original format was clear and commonly used. This leads to a breakdown
            in the conversation as it introduces an unnecessary obstacle to completing
            the task. The breakdown types that apply here are 'Clarification failure'
            because the chatbot should have accepted the time format as it was clear,
            and 'Lack of common sense' because the chatbot's insistence on a specific
            time format is not aligned with common conversational norms.
