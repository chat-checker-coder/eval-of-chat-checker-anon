    content: The Mathematical Bridge, officially known as the Wooden Bridge, is a
        popular attraction in Cambridge. It connects two parts of Queens' College
        over the River Cam. The bridge was originally built in 1749 by James Essex,
        following a design commonly attributed to William Etheridge. It's famed for
        its design that appears to be an arch made entirely from straight timbers,
        though this is an optical illusion. The bridge has been rebuilt twice, in
        1866 and 1905, but has always maintained its distinctive architectural style.
        It's often associated with a myth that Sir Isaac Newton built it without the
        use of any nuts or bolts, although he died 22 years before the bridge was
        constructed.
