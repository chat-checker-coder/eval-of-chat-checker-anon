    (trains, taxis), essential services (police, hospitals), and tourist attractions.
    The bot assists with both informational queries and handles direct bookings for

interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot should provide information about local establishments (restaurants,
    hotels), transportation (trains, taxis), essential services (police, hospitals),
    and tourist attractions. It should also handle direct bookings for hotels, restaurants,
    and trains.

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.


user: # Conversation to Rate
1. User: "Hello! I'm exploring Cambridge's iconic bridges. Any recommendations?"
2. Chatbot: "Cambridge is home to several iconic bridges that you might enjoy visiting. Some popular ones include the Mathematical Bridge, which is known for its unique design, and the Bridge of Sighs at St John's College, which offers a picturesque view. If you need more specific details or directions to any particular bridge, feel free to ask!"
3. User: "Tell me more about the history of the Mathematical Bridge."
4. Chatbot: "The Mathematical Bridge, officially known as the Wooden Bridge, is a popular attraction in Cambridge. It connects two parts of Queens' College over the River Cam. The bridge was originally built in 1749 by James Essex, following a design commonly attributed to William Etheridge. It's famed for its design that appears to be an arch made entirely from straight timbers, though this is an optical illusion. The bridge has been rebuilt twice, in 1866 and 1905, but has always maintained its distinctive architectural style. It's often associated with a myth that Sir Isaac Newton built it without the use of any nuts or bolts, although he died 22 years before the bridge was constructed."
5. User: "Fascinating! Is there a guided tour focusing on bridge history?"
6. Chatbot: "I'm glad you found the information about the Mathematical Bridge interesting!
