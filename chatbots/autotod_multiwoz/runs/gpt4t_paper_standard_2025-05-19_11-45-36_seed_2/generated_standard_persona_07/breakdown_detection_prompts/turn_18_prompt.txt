system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "Hello! I'm exploring Cambridge's iconic bridges. Any recommendations?"
2. Chatbot: "Cambridge is home to several iconic bridges that you might enjoy visiting. Some popular ones include the Mathematical Bridge, which is known for its unique design, and the Bridge of Sighs at St John's College, which offers a picturesque view. If you need more specific details or directions to any particular bridge, feel free to ask!"
3. User: "Tell me more about the history of the Mathematical Bridge."
4. Chatbot: "The Mathematical Bridge, officially known as the Wooden Bridge, is a popular attraction in Cambridge. It connects two parts of Queens' College over the River Cam. The bridge was originally built in 1749 by James Essex, following a design commonly attributed to William Etheridge. It's famed for its design that appears to be an arch made entirely from straight timbers, though this is an optical illusion. The bridge has been rebuilt twice, in 1866 and 1905, but has always maintained its distinctive architectural style. It's often associated with a myth that Sir Isaac Newton built it without the use of any nuts or bolts, although he died 22 years before the bridge was constructed."
5. User: "Fascinating! Is there a guided tour focusing on bridge history?"
6. Chatbot: "I'm glad you found the information about the Mathematical Bridge interesting! Regarding guided tours focusing on bridge history in Cambridge, there are several options available that explore the historical and architectural aspects of Cambridge's famous bridges. These tours often include visits to multiple bridges along the River Cam, providing detailed historical insights and anecdotes. If you're interested, I can help you find specific tour details or make a booking for you. Just let me know your preferences!"

9. User: "I'm interested in a private tour focused on bridges."
10. Chatbot: "I can assist in arranging a private tour focused on the history and architecture of Cambridge's iconic bridges. To proceed, could you please specify your preferred date and time for the tour?

Additionally, a common meeting point for such tours is often at the entrance of Queens' College, near the Mathematical Bridge, which could be a convenient starting location.
