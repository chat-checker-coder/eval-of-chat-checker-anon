2. CHATBOT: "For your day trip to Cambridge, I found some budget-friendly attractions you might enjoy. You can visit "All Saints Church" known for its architecture, "Broughton House Gallery," "Byard Art," "Cafe Jello Gallery," and "Cambridge Artworks," all of which are museums and free to enter. Unfortunately, there are no budget-friendly restaurants listed in the central area of Cambridge. Perhaps exploring local cafes or street food might be a good alternative. Enjoy your trip!"
