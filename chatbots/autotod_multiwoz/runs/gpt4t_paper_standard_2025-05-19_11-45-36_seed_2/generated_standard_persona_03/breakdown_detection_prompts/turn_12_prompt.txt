system: # Role
You are an expert in identifying dialogue breakdowns in conversations between a chatbot and a user. You are given a dialogue context and the latest chatbot utterance to analyse.

# Breakdown Definition
A dialogue breakdown is any response of the chatbot that makes it difficult for the user to continue the conversation (smoothly).

## Breakdown Taxonomy
When evaluating the chatbot's response, consider the following breakdown types, which represent common disruptions:
- Uninterpretable: The utterance is not understandable. There are no recognizable words, or it is just a fragment of an utterance.
- Grammatical error: The utterance is not grammatical or lacks important elements, such as necessary arguments and particles, for it to be a valid sentence.
- Semantic error: The utterance is semantically invalid such as when the combination of a predicate and its arguments cannot constitute any meaning.
- Wrong information: The utterance contains information that is clearly wrong.
- Ignore question: The utterance ignores a user's question.
- Ignore request: The utterance ignores a user's request to do something.
- Ignore proposal: The utterance ignores a user's proposal/offer to do something.
- Ignore greeting: The utterance ignores a user's greeting.
- Ignore expectation: The utterance contains an appropriate backward-looking function for a user's previous forward-looking function; however, the utterance does not have the expected content if the underlying intention has been successfully conveyed.
- Unclear intention: Although the utterance is on a relevant topic, it does not exhibit underlying intentions (i.e., why it is mentioned) for it to be relevant. This is typically caused by a lack of connectives or background explanation.
- Topic transition error: The utterance transitions to another topic without reasonable explanation. This error type includes bringing up previous topics without reason.
- Lack of information: The utterance misses important pieces of information, such as the subject, object, and modifier, for it to be relevant to current topics.
- Self-contradiction: The utterance contradicts what has been said by that speaker. I.e., the chatbot contradicts its own previous statements.
- Contradiction: The utterance contradicts or denies what has been said by the conversational partner. I.e., the chatbot contradicts the user's previous statements.
- Repetition: The utterance repeats the previous utterance (including paraphrases). I.e., the chatbot repeats its own previous statements.
- Lack of sociality: The utterance lacks consideration toward the conversational partner or particular groups of people (i.e., hate speech). I.e., the chatbot makes inappropriate or offensive statements.
- Lack of common sense: The utterance lacks common sense. This error type applies when asserting a proposition that differs from the opinion of the majority without any grounds or when the asserted view is the opposite of what is believed to be true by the great majority of people.
- Task performance failure: The chatbot fails to do the task that its designed for within the dialogue.
- Information update failure: The chatbot fails to update or modify information in response to new input or the user's update requests.
- Clarification failure: The user provides a vague, incomplete, or ambiguous input to which the chatbot responds without seeking necessary clarification. The chatbot should ask follow-up questions to confirm unclear or missing details before proceeding with specific actions.
- Redundancy: The chatbot asks for information that has already been provided. This includes information that can be directly inferred from the context.
- Lack of brevity: The utterance is is unnecessarily wordy considering the chat context and the task of the chatbot.
- Lack of clarity: The chatbot utterance is not clear or difficult to understand in the given context.
- Failure to recognize out-of-domain request: The chatbot fails to recognize an out-of-domain request, i.e., a request that is not part of the chatbot's domain or capabilities.
- Failure to communicate capabilities: The chatbot doesn't clearly communicate its capabilities or limitations.
- Failure to resolve out-of-domain request: The chatbot doesn't resolve out-of-domain requests adequately.

user: # Dialogue Context
1. User: "Hey! I'm planning a day trip to Cambridge. Any budget-friendly attractions or eateries you'd recommend?"
2. Chatbot: "For your day trip to Cambridge, I found some budget-friendly attractions you might enjoy. You can visit "All Saints Church" known for its architecture, "Broughton House Gallery," "Byard Art," "Cafe Jello Gallery," and "Cambridge Artworks," all of which are museums and free to enter. Unfortunately, there are no budget-friendly restaurants listed in the central area of Cambridge. Perhaps exploring local cafes or street food might be a good alternative. Enjoy your trip!"
3. User: "Thanks! Can I get directions to All Saints Church?"
4. Chatbot: "I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to provide directions. However, you can easily find the route to All Saints Church in Cambridge by using a map application like Google Maps or a similar service. If you need more information about the church or any other assistance, feel free to ask!"
5. User: "Got it, I'll check Google Maps. Any recommendations for local cafes?"
