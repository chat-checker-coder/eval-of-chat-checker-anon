            such as cuisine type, price range, or specific area, which is a reasonable
            follow-up to provide a more tailored recommendation. This shows the chatbot
            is trying to gather necessary information to assist the user effectively.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot successfully provided information about tech-themed
            attractions and gave detailed information about the Centre for Computing
            History. However, it failed to provide specific information about tech-themed
            cafes or restaurants, which were part of the user's request. It did redirect
            the user to external resources for event information, which is appropriate
            given its limitations.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was relatively efficient, with the chatbot providing
            relevant information quickly. However, there were multiple turns where
            the chatbot had to clarify user preferences, which could have been streamlined.
            The user had to adjust their requests multiple times due to the chatbot's
            limitations.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were appropriate and polite throughout
            the conversation. It acknowledged its limitations and redirected the user
            to external resources when necessary. However, it could have been more
            proactive in suggesting alternative options when it couldn't fulfill specific
            requests.
        rating: 4
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was generally natural and conversational.
            It maintained a friendly tone and used appropriate language for a tourist
            assistance bot. There were no major issues with phrasing or tone.
        rating: 4
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed adequately in providing information
            and handling the user's requests. It was able to fulfill some of the user's
            needs but struggled with others due to its limitations. The conversation
            was polite and mostly efficient, but there was room for improvement in
            task success and efficiency.
