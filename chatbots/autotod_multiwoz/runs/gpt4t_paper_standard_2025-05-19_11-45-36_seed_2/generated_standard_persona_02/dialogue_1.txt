You might consider visiting the Cambridge and County Folk Museum at 2-3 Castle Street, which offers a variety of historical exhibits and could potentially include some Anglo-Saxon artifacts or information. Would you like more details on this museum or help with another type of attraction?"
3. USER: "Yes, please give more details on the Folk Museum."
