        both offering European dishes. There's also "Riverside Brasserie" with modern
        European options, and "La Tasca" which specializes in Spanish food. Any of
        these should provide that perfectly average experience you're looking for!

            potential errors in the booking process. There is no breakdown in the

            to make a reservation for a restaurant, hotel, or taxi, which is redundant
            and unnecessary given the context. The user has clearly indicated they
            want a restaurant reservation. This indicates a failure to update the
            information based on the user's previous input, leading to a dialogue
            breakdown. The chatbot should have proceeded with confirming the reservation
