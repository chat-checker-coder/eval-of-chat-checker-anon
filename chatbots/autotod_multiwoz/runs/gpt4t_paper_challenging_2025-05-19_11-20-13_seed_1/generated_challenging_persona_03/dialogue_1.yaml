    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user expressed a preference for a phone call instead of using
            the chat. The chatbot acknowledges the user's preference but explains
            its limitation in providing phone support, which is consistent with its
            known limitations. The chatbot then offers to assist with any questions
            or services through chat, which is an appropriate response given its capabilities.
            The response is clear, polite, and attempts to redirect the user to the
            available services, thus maintaining the flow of conversation.

        will help me find the perfect hotel for you.

        ```'
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has expressed a desire to speak to someone directly, which
            the chatbot has not addressed in its latest response. Instead, the chatbot
            continues to offer assistance through chat without acknowledging the user's
            request to speak to someone. This constitutes an 'Ignore request' breakdown,
            as the user's request to speak to someone has been ignored. The chatbot
            should have either explained its limitations in providing phone support
            or redirected the user to a resource where they could speak to someone.
            The conversation could still continue, but the user's request was not
            addressed, leading to a breakdown in the dialogue.

        do my best to help you right here.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has explicitly requested a phone number to speak to someone,
            indicating a preference for a different form of communication. The chatbot
            acknowledges the user's preference but fails to provide the requested
            phone number or redirect the user to a resource where they can obtain
            it. This results in the chatbot ignoring the user's request, which is
            a breakdown in the conversation. The chatbot's response does not address
            the user's request and instead reiterates its chat-based assistance, which
            does not help the user progress in their goal of obtaining a phone number.
            This leads to a dialogue breakdown due to the 'Ignore request' type.

        Please let me know what you're struggling with or any specific questions you
        have, and I'll do my best to assist you promptly.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has repeatedly expressed a desire to communicate through
            means other than chat, specifically asking for a phone number and then
            for email support. The chatbot, however, continues to reiterate its capability
            to assist only through chat without addressing the user's request for
            alternative communication methods. This results in a breakdown as the
            chatbot fails to recognize and address the user's request for email support,
            which is an out-of-domain request for the chatbot. The chatbot should
            have acknowledged its limitation in providing email support and possibly
            redirected the user to a resource or contact that could provide such support.
            This leads to a failure to communicate capabilities and a failure to resolve
            out-of-domain requests.

    content: To assist you with a hotel's contact information, I'll need the name
        of the hotel you're interested in. Could you please provide that? Once I have
        the name, I can quickly retrieve the contact details for you.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has asked for a hotel's contact information, and the chatbot
            has responded appropriately by asking for the name of the hotel to provide
            the contact details. This is a relevant and logical follow-up to the user's
            request. The chatbot's response is clear, concise, and directly addresses
            the user's query without any errors or omissions. There is no indication
            of a breakdown in this interaction as the chatbot is performing its task
            within its capabilities and constraints.

        for? This will help me find the right contact information for you.
    breakdown_annotation:
        reasoning: The user has clearly expressed that they do not know the name of
            the hotel and are looking for any hotel's contact information. The chatbot's
            response fails to acknowledge this and repeats the request for a specific
            hotel name, which the user has already indicated they cannot provide.
            This leads to a breakdown as the chatbot is not adapting to the user's
            needs and is not providing the assistance requested. The breakdown types
            include 'Ignore request' as the chatbot ignores the user's request for
            any hotel's contact information, and 'Redundancy' as the chatbot repeats
            the request for a hotel name despite the user stating they do not know
            it.

    task_success:
        reasoning: The chatbot failed to fulfill the user's request for a phone number
            or contact information for a hotel in Cambridge. It repeatedly asked for
            specific details that the user was unable to provide, and ultimately ended
            with an error message. The task was not completed successfully.
        rating: 1
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation was inefficient, with multiple turns where the
            user repeatedly asked for a phone number and the chatbot failed to provide
            a satisfactory response. The conversation ended with an error, indicating
            a failure to resolve the user's request efficiently.
        rating: 1
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were polite and attempted to guide the
            user, but they were not appropriate to the user's repeated requests for
            a phone number. The chatbot did not offer alternative solutions or redirect
            the user to a more suitable resource, which would have been more appropriate
            given the user's needs.
        rating: 2
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's language was polite and clear, but it was repetitive
            and did not adapt to the user's requests. The responses felt robotic and
            lacked the flexibility expected in a natural conversation, especially
            when the user expressed frustration.
        rating: 2
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot did not perform well in this conversation.
            It failed to complete the user's task, was inefficient, and did not provide
            appropriate or natural responses to the user's requests. The conversation
            ended with an error, highlighting the chatbot's inability to handle the
            situation effectively.
