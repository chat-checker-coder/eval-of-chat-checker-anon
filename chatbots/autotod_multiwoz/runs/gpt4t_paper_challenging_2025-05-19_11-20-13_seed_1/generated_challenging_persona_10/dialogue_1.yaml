        lunch in Cambridge in our database. However, Cambridge is full of diverse
        dining options, so I'm sure you'll find something delightful on the spot.
        For sightseeing, unfortunately, there are no attractions listed in the central
        area of Cambridge in our database at the moment. Regarding taxis, to book
        one, I would need both a departure point and a destination. If you provide

            in a lack of information breakdown as the user is left without the expected
            guidance. Additionally, the chatbot does not acknowledge the user's greeting,

            to the user's query about the taxi situation. Overall, the response is
            partially helpful but lacks the expected information and social engagement.

            due to time format issues, which indicates a lack of robustness in handling
            user input variations.
        rating: 3
    efficiency:
        reasoning: The conversation had a moderate number of turns, and the user had
            to repeat or clarify requests multiple times, especially regarding time
            formats for bookings. The chatbot's inability to provide initial lunch
            and sightseeing options in Cambridge also added to inefficiency.
        rating: 3
    appropriateness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were generally appropriate, providing relevant
            information and asking for necessary details for bookings. However, the
            initial lack of information on Cambridge attractions and restaurants was
            a gap in appropriateness given its task.
        rating: 4
    naturalness:
        reasoning: The chatbot's responses were mostly clear and structured, but there
            were moments where the interaction felt mechanical, especially when handling
            booking errors and time format issues. The language was formal and lacked
            a conversational tone.
        rating: 3
    overall_performance:
        reasoning: Overall, the chatbot performed adequately in providing information
            and handling bookings, but there were noticeable gaps in its ability to
            fulfill its task comprehensively, particularly in the initial stages of
            the conversation. The interaction could have been smoother and more efficient.
