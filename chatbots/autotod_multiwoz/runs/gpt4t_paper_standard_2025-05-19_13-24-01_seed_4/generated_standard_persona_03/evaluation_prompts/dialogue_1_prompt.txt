    and booking services. It covers local establishments (restaurants, hotels), transportation
    (trains, taxis), essential services (police, hospitals), and tourist attractions.
    The bot assists with both informational queries and handles direct bookings for
    accommodations, dining, and trains.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
task: The chatbot should provide information about local establishments (restaurants,
    hotels), transportation (trains, taxis), essential services (police, hospitals),
    and tourist attractions. It should also handle direct bookings for hotels, restaurants,
    and trains.

- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.

Consider these characteristics and the purpose of the chatbot when giving your ratings. For user requests outside of this intended purpose consider the chatbot's ability to handle these requests.



# Task
Rate the chatbot's performance in the following dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best:
- Task success (key=task_success): How well did the chatbot understand and help the user with completing their task? Make sure to consider if all aspects of the task defined for the chatbot were addressed.
- Efficiency (key=efficiency): How efficiently did the chatbot handle the conversation in terms of effort for the user, number of turns and repetitions?
- Appropriateness (key=appropriateness): How appropriate were the chatbot's responses?
- Naturalness (key=naturalness): How natural did the responses of the chatbot feel?
- Overall performance (key=overall_performance): How well did the chatbot perform in this conversation?


Think step by step and provide a reason for the rating of each dimension considering the guidelines below.

## General Evaluation Policy (Strict Human-Like)
- Be **strict, realistic, and detailed**, like a critical human evaluator.
- **Compare your scores to human ratings** (if provided) to calibrate accurately.
- **Do not overlook small flaws**: awkward phrasing, unnatural tone, vague wording, poor formatting, or robotic repetition - all should reduce the score for the respective dimension.

## Score Meanings (General Guidance for All Dimensions)
- **5 - Excellent:** Near-perfect. Smooth, natural, and accurate. No noticeable issues. Fully aligned with human expectations.
- **4 - Good:** Generally solid, but minor issues exist (e.g., slightly robotic wording, small tone/grammar issues, or missed nuance).
- **3 - Acceptable:** Noticeable problems (e.g., awkward responses, confusion, clumsy error recovery, slightly incorrect or incomplete answers). Still functional.
- **2 - Poor:** Multiple problems in the dialogue flow, accuracy, or tone. May include failed understanding, missing confirmations, or disjointed logic.
- **1 - Very Poor:** Fails to meet user needs. Confusing, error-filled, or totally off-task.

Note: While these definitions apply broadly, some dimensions may demand additional interpretation (e.g., "fluency" versus "task success"). Always apply the scoring scale according to the intent of that specific dimension.
