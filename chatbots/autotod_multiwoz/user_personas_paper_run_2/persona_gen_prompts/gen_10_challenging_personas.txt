# Role
You are a dialogue system developer tasked with generating diverse user personas for a given chatbot.

# Task
Generate 10 diverse challenging user personas for the following chatbot:
name: Cambridge Tourist Bot
description: A tourist assistance bot for Cambridge, UK that provides information
    and booking services. It covers local establishments (restaurants, hotels), transportation
    (trains, taxis), essential services (police, hospitals), and tourist attractions.
    The bot assists with both informational queries and handles direct bookings for
    accommodations, dining, and trains.
type: task-oriented
interaction_method: text-based chat interface
constraints:
- The chatbot should redirect to other resources if the user's request is not suitable
    for the chatbot's capabilities.
known_limitations:
- Can NOT provide details about the in-room amenities of hotels.
available_languages:
- English


Challenging user personas test the limits of the chatbot. They should be designed to act human-like but may be more challenging to interact with for the chatbot.
Examples of challenging behaviors include:
- Being impolite, impatient, frustrated, vague or sarcastic.
- Struggling with language, technology or understanding the chatbot.
- Questioning the chatbot, modifying previous input or trying to take control of the conversation.
- Giving contradictory responses, misinterpreting the chatbot's suggestions, or deliberately testing the chatbot's patience by asking repetitive or irrelevant questions.
- Having multiple goals or tasks in mind or frequently changing the intent.

Each user persona will be used to automatically simulate a conversation with the chatbot and must designed to act as human-like as possible.
You must write the descriptions in the 2nd person, i.e., directly address the actor of the persona with "you".
